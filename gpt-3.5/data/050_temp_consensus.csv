Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1). In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: â€œA special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation.â€ (Citation2). Several of his microscopes still exist. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3â€“6). He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a â€œmortal oscillatory rateâ€, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3â€“6). Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as â€˜radionicsâ€™ (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8). Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10â€“12).

Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with â‰ˆ8.6 million people. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.",PNAS,2008,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT,NEI,CONTRADICT

Ezekiel & Rakesh Pandey","World over, potatoes are being stored at 8â€“12 Â°C (85â€“90 % RH). This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8â€“12 Â°C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.",Journal of Food Science and Technology,2015,CONTRADICT,NEI,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3â€“7% over the past decades. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.",Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,2020,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint.

Fellah, Ahmed Elmarghani & Iman Amin Al msellati","The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) was identified as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The virus spreads primarily through saliva droplets or nasal discharges, in addition to coughing or sneezing from an infected person. The most common symptom at the onset of illness is fever, which may appear within 2â€“14 days after exposure. The high fever (above 38 Â°C) can persist from one to 4 days. The febrile illness usually has a variable negative impact on sperm characteristics such as sperm output, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation. These defects proliferated due to an increase in testicular temperature, and disturbance in the thermoregulatory systems that are responsible for the testicular heat loss. Coronavirus studies suggest that fever from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induces a reversible negative effect on the sperm parameters until one cycle (74 days) of spermatogenesis. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 can have long-term adverse effects on testicles via immune or inflammatory reactions after the patient has fully recovered.

Meyers and Alberto Malinverno,"The geologic record of Milankovitch climate cycles provides a rich conceptual and temporal framework for evaluating Earth system evolution, bestowing a sharp lens through which to view our planetâ€™s history. However, the utility of these cycles for constraining the early Earth system is hindered by seemingly insurmountable uncertainties in our knowledge of solar system behavior (including Earthâ€“Moon history), and poor temporal control for validation of cycle periods (e.g., from radioisotopic dates). Here we address these problems using a Bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively link astronomical theory with geologic observation, allowing a reconstruction of Proterozoic astronomical cycles, fundamental frequencies of the solar system, the precession constant, and the underlying geologic timescale, directly from stratigraphic data. Application of the approach to 1.4-billion-year-old rhythmites indicates a precession constant of 85.79 Â± 2.72 arcsec/year (2Ïƒ), an Earthâ€“Moon distance of 340,900 Â± 2,600 km (2Ïƒ), and length of day of 18.68 Â± 0.25 hours (2Ïƒ), with dominant climatic precession cycles of âˆ¼14 ky and eccentricity cycles of âˆ¼131 ky. The results confirm reduced tidal dissipation in the Proterozoic. A complementary analysis of Eocene rhythmites (âˆ¼55 Ma) illustrates how the approach offers a means to map out ancient solar system behavior and Earthâ€“Moon history using the geologic archive. The method also provides robust quantitative uncertainties on the eccentricity and climatic precession periods, and derived astronomical timescales. As a consequence, the temporal resolution of ancient Earth system processes is enhanced, and our knowledge of early solar system dynamics is greatly improved.",PNAS,2018,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Ice forms in the local autumn/winter and melts in local spring/summer, driven by exchanges of heat between the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere. Sea ice is typically bright â€“ snow-covered ice can reflect away more than 80% of incoming solar radiation. As sea ice melts, it exposes the darker (less reflective) water beneath it, and the planet's surface becomes darker and warmer overall. By this mechanism, changes in sea ice can amplify changes in the climate system (e.g. warming leads to melt, exposing darker surfaces, which leads to additional absorption of incoming sunlight and therefore more melt).

We show that the bleaching responses of corals to a given level of heat exposure differed in each event and were strongly influenced by contingency and the spatial overlap and strength of interactions between events. Naive regions that escaped bleaching for a decade or longer were the most susceptible to bouts of heat exposure. Conversely, when pairs of successive bleaching episodes were close together (1â€“3 years apart), the thermal threshold for severe bleaching increased because the earlier event hardened regions of the Great Barrier Reef to further impacts. In the near future, the biological responses to recurrent bleaching events may become stronger as the cumulative geographic footprint expands further, potentially impairing the stock-recruitment relationships among lightly and severely bleached reefs with diverse recent histories.

A homologous schedule was defined as receiving the same vaccine type for doses 1 and 2. Incident outcome events were defined as the date of first inpatient hospital admission based on primary or secondary discharge diagnosis for myocarditis or pericarditis from December 27, 2020, onward. Secondary outcome was myocarditis or pericarditis combined from either inpatient or outpatient hospital care. Poisson regression yielded adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and excess rates with 95% CIs, comparing rates of myocarditis or pericarditis in the 28-day period following vaccination with rates among unvaccinated individuals. Among 23â€¯122â€¯522 Nordic residents (81% vaccinated by study end; 50.2% female), 1077 incident myocarditis events and 1149 incident pericarditis events were identified.

Patients on anticoagulant therapy such as heparin have diminished clotting potential and are at risk for hemorrhaging. Here we describe a self-assembling nanofibrous peptide hydrogel (termed SLac) that on its own can act as a physical barrier to blood loss. SLac was loaded with snake-venom derived Batroxobin (50 Î¼g/mL) yielding a drug-loaded hydrogel (SB50). SB50 was potentiated to enhance clotting even in the presence of heparin. In vitro evaluation of fibrin and whole blood clotting helped identify appropriate concentrations for hemostasis in vivo. Batroxobin-loaded hydrogels rapidly (within 20s) stop bleeding in both normal and heparin-treated rats in a lateral liver incision model. Compared to standard of care, Gelfoam, and investigational hemostats such as Puramatrix, only SB50 showed rapid liver incision hemostasis post surgical application.

We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, in which supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission.

Bader, Philip Orton & Cynthia Rosenzweig","The 837 km New York City shoreline is lined by significant economic assets and dense population vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New York City developed a comprehensive plan to mitigate future climate risks, drawing upon the scientific expertise of the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), a special advisory group comprised of university and private-sector experts. This paper highlights current NPCC findings regarding sea level rise and coastal flooding, with some of the Cityâ€™s ongoing and planned responses. Twentieth century sea level rise in New York City (2.8 cm/decade) exceeded the global average (1.7 cm/decade), underscoring the enhanced regional risk to coastal hazards. NPCC (2015) projects future sea level rise at the Battery of 28â€“53 cm by the 2050s and 46â€“99 cm by the 2080s, relative to 2000â€“2004 (mid-range, 25thâ€“75th percentile). High-end SLR estimates (90th percentile) reach 76 cm by the 2050s, and 1.9 m by 2100. Combining these projections with updated FEMA flood return period curves, assuming static flood dynamics and storm behavior, flood heights for the 100-year storm (excluding waves) attain 3.9â€“4.5 m (mid-range), relative to the NAVD88 tidal datum, and 4.9 m (high end) by the 2080s, up from 3.4 m in the 2000s. Flood heights with a 1% annual chance of occurrence in the 2000s increase to 2.0â€“5.4% (mid-range) and 12.7% per year (high-end), by the 2080s. Guided by NPCC (2013, 2015) findings, New York City has embarked on a suite of initiatives to strengthen coastal defenses, employing various approaches tailored to specific neighborhood needs. NPCC continues its collaboration with the city to investigate vulnerability to extreme climate events, including heat waves, inland floods and coastal storms. Current research entails higher-resolution neighborhood-level coastal flood mapping, changes in storm characteristics, surge height interactions with sea level rise, and stronger engagement with stakeholders and community-based organizations.",Climate Change Adaptation in North America,2017,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Although the â€˜Swiss modelâ€™ for suicide assistance has been extensively described in the literature, the formally and informally protected liberties and claims of assistors and recipients of suicide assistance in Switzerland are incompletely captured in the literature. In this article, we describe the package of rights involved in the â€˜Swiss modelâ€™ using the framework of Hohfeldian rights as modified by Wenar. After outlining this framework, we dissect the rights involved in suicide assistance in Switzerland, and compare it with the situation in England and Germany. Based on this approach, we conclude that in Switzerland, claim rights exist for those requesting suicide assistance, and for those who are considering providing such assistance, even though no entitlements exist toward suicide assistance. We then describe the implementation of the â€˜Swiss modelâ€™ and difficulties arising within it. Clarifying these issues is important to understand the Swiss situation, to evaluate what features of it may or may not be worth correcting or emulating, and to understand how it can impact requests for suicide assistance in other countries due to â€˜suicide tourismâ€™.

Each additional unit area of an ecosystem provides an increasingly smaller unit of time taken for that system to collapse, meaning that large systems tend to shift more slowly than small systems but disproportionately faster. We substantiate these findings with five computational models that reveal the importance of system structure in controlling shift duration. The findings imply that shifts in Earth ecosystems occur over â€˜humanâ€™ timescales of years and decades, meaning the collapse of large vulnerable ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest and Caribbean coral reefs, may take only a few decades once triggered.",Nature Communications,2020,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Konyukhov,"Oil source rocks represent sequences with the Corg content ranging from 3â€“5 to 15â€“20%. Sedimentary sections of large petroliferous basins usually include one or two such sequences, which generated liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons (HCs) during their long-term subsidence to the elevated temperature zone. The middle episode of the Late Cretaceous was marked by the accumulation of sediments with a high Corg content in different areas of the World Ocean. However, truly unique settings favorable for accumulation of the sapropelic organic matter (OM) appeared at continental margins that primarily faced the Tethys Ocean. The La Luna Formation is one of the best known source rock sequences responsible for the generation of liquid HCs in basins of the Caribbean region. In the Persian Gulf, the Kazhdumi Formation composed of marls and clayey limestones is considered the main oil-generating sequence. In the Paleogene after closure of the Tethys, the Pacific continental margins became the main domains that accumulated source rocks. The maximal deposition of sapropelic OM in this region corresponded to the early-middle Eocene. In the Neogene, the accumulation of source sediments was associated with deltas and submarine fans of large rivers and with upwelling zones. In basins of the Californian borderland, the main oil-generating sequences are represented by siliceous rocks of the Monterey Formation.

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viralâ€“host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery.

Italy is only anticipating what will be the trend in the whole of Europe and elsewhere. At the beginning of March 2020, the first nasopharyngeal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 started to be detected in the Northern Eastern Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. These identifications followed the expansion of the two clusters in Lombardy and Veneto that emerged in the previous weeks in northern Italy (4). Swab contents were seeded on Vero E6 cells and monitored for cytopathic effect and by an RT-PCR protocol using primers for the N region (5). Cell culture supernatants from passage 1 (P1) of four isolates were collected, and RNA was extracted with QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) and quantified with an in vitro-transcribed RNA standard (S.

However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial & Museumâ€™s â€œTribute in Lightâ€ in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km. We estimate that the installation influenced â‰ˆ1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each yearâ€™s observations. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.",PNAS,2017,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Energy storage is paramount in electric and hybrid vehicles, in green but intermittent energy sources, and in smart grids in general. Lithium is a vital raw material for the build-up of both currently available lithium-ion batteries, and prospective next generation batteries such as lithium-air and lithium sulphur. The continued availability of lithium can only rely on a strong increase of mining and ore processing. It would be an inconsistency if the increased production of lithium for a more sustainable society would be associated with non-sustainable mining practices. Currently 2/3 of the world production of lithium is extracted from brines, a practice that evaporates on average half a million litres of brine per ton of lithium carbonate. Furthermore, the extraction is chemical intensive, extremely slow, and delivers large volumes of waste.

However, the increased sensitivity is in many ways a double-edged sword as background contaminating DNA generated during the manufacture of consumables and sampling devices is now being detected and may compromise the interpretation of the DNA profile results. This study initially demonstrated the effectiveness of ethylene oxide (EO) as a post-production treatment to eliminate DNA on swabs, used as a sampling device for the recovery of cellular material. Subsequently, the potential adverse effects of any residual EO remaining on the swabs on the downstream DNA analysis on both rayon and cotton swabs were investigated and the levels of remaining EO measured. Two main variables were tested: the amount of time elapsed since EO treatment of the swabs prior to use, and the time elapsed between cellular material collection and DNA analysis. Residual levels of EO were found to be below quantitation levels and therefore also international standards. The results indicated that while there was a negligible effect of EO treatment on DNA recovered from rayon swabs, there was however an adverse effect on the DNA profiles recovered from cotton swabs. The adverse effect was negatively correlated with time since EO treatment and positively correlated with time to DNA analysis.",Science & Justice,2017,SUPPORT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Keoleian, Martin C. Heller, Diego Rose","Linkages between diet and environmental impact have been repeatedly emphasized at the global and national level, with an indication that shifts in diet, typically toward more plant-based foods, can lead to significant reduction in environmental impact. In this study, we explore the effect on food system greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) of a hypothetical reduction in the consumption of animal-based foods in the US diet and a replacement with plant-based foods. USDAâ€™s Loss Adjusted Food Availability (LAFA) dataset, a top-down estimate of the per capita consumption of commodity foods in the US, is used to represent the baseline, or current, US diet. Greenhouse gas emission factors previously compiled from life cycle assessment literature were linked to these commodity foods to estimate the per capita GHGE associated with agricultural production of the average diet. A number of dietary scenarios projected to 2030 were then developed: 1. The baseline average diet remains unchanged to 2030 2. Meat and poultry consumption increases per USDA projections 3. Consumption of animal-based foods (red meat, poultry, fish/seafood, eggs, dairy, and animal based fats) decreases by 50%, and is substituted with plant-based foods 4. Same as scenario 3, but beef decreases by 90%, instead of 50%. The total emissions associated with producing the average US diet amounts to 5.0 kg CO2 eq. per person per day. Whereas red meat (beef, pork, lamb) represents 9% of the calories available from this diet, it contributes 47% of the GHGE. All animal-based foods combined (red meat, poultry, fish/seafood, eggs, dairy, and animal based fats) represent 82% of the baseline diet GHGE. According to LAFA data, the average American consumed 133 pounds of red meat and poultry in 2016. USDA projects slight increases in per capita red meat and poultry consumption in the US in 2028 (scenario 2); assuming other foods unchanged, this raises the carbon footprint to 5.14 kg CO2 eq. per person per day. Cutting the intake of all animal-based foods by half and replacing with equivalent quantities of plantbased foods (scenario 3) results in a 35% decrease in GHGE from the baseline, to 3.3 kg CO2 eq per person per day. Under this scenario 3, red meat represents 36% of the total emissions. Further reducing consumption of beef to only 10% of the baseline value, and subsequent replacement with plant-based proteins (scenario 4), cuts the diet-related emissions to 2.4 kg CO2 eq per capita per day, a 51 % decrease from the baseline diet. Under this final scenario 4, the average American consumes 50.1 pounds of meat and poultry per year. Using population projections from the US Census Bureau, an unchanged diet would result in 646 million metric tonnes CO2 eq. (MMT) in 2030, whereas scenario 3 â€“ replacing 50% of all animal-based foods with plant-based alternatives â€“ leads to 224 MMT less emissions per year in 2030, a reduction equivalent to the annual emissions of 47.5 million of todayâ€™s average passenger vehicles. If we assume a linear transition from the 2016 diet to 2030 projections, this target of 50% substitution results in an estimated cumulative reduction of 1634 MMT. By further replacing 90% of beef, the cumulative emission reduction increases to 2408 MMT. Although reliant on a number of simplifying assumptions, this diet projection exercise emphasizes the important role that changes in diet can play in climate action. An annual emission reduction of 224 MMT represents 24% of the reduction from 2017 emissions required to meet the US Intended Nationally sizable reductions are possible without complete elimination of animal-based foods from the diet can make diet shift strategy more palatable. Such changes, however, will require the concerted efforts of policymakers, the food industry and consumers. The projection scenarios presented here point to the urgency of such efforts, as decisions made now will have a cumulative impact over the next decade.",University of Michigan: Ann Arbor,2020,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Westrip, Hannah Wheatley","Determining whether species have gone extinct requires considering the timing and reliability of records, the timing and adequacy of surveys, and the timing, extent and intensity of threats. However, previous assessments have either applied qualitative approaches or considered only the first of these factors. We applied quantitative methods encompassing all three factors to a suite of 61 potentially or confirmed extinct species of birds. We tested six different methods, each with a range of thresholds, for assigning species to IUCN Red List Categories, and compared the results with species' current categories. We recommend that if both the probability that a species remains extant based on threats and the probability based on records and surveys fall below 0.5, it should qualify as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), while if both probabilities fall below 0.1 it should qualify as Extinct. This novel approach resulted in an 80% match with the current IUCN Red List classification of species. The exceptions largely reflect species whose reclassification was pending the outcome of this work. Consequently, we recommend that nine species are reclassified on the IUCN Red List, with cryptic treehunter (Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti), Alagoas foliage-gleaner (Philydor novaesi) poo-uli (Melamprosops phaeosoma) now qualifying as Extinct.

Michael, A. J. Bron","Cataract is a visible opacity in the lens substance, which, when located on the visual axis, leads to visual loss. Age-related cataract is a cause of blindness on a global scale involving genetic and environmental influences. With ageing, lens proteins undergo non-enzymatic, post-translational modification and the accumulation of fluorescent chromophores, increasing susceptibility to oxidation and cross-linking and increased light-scatter. Because the human lens grows throughout life, the lens core is exposed for a longer period to such influences and the risk of oxidative damage increases in the fourth decade when a barrier to the transport of glutathione forms around the lens nucleus. Consequently, as the lens ages, its transparency falls and the nucleus becomes more rigid, resisting the change in shape necessary for accommodation. This is the basis of presbyopia. In some individuals, the steady accumulation of chromophores and complex, insoluble crystallin aggregates in the lens nucleus leads to the formation of a brown nuclear cataract. The process is homogeneous and the affected lens fibres retain their gross morphology. Cortical opacities are due to changes in membrane permeability and enzyme function and shear-stress damage to lens fibres with continued accommodative effort. Unlike nuclear cataract, progression is intermittent, stepwise and non-uniform.",Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,2011,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Inequity aversion is thought to be the driving force behind unselfish motivated punishment in humans constituting a powerful device for the enforcement of cooperation. Recent research indicates that non-human primates refuse to participate in cooperative problem-solving tasks if they witness a conspecific obtaining a more attractive reward for the same effort. However, little is known about non-primate species, although inequity aversion may also be expected in other cooperative species. Here, we investigated whether domestic dogs show sensitivity toward the inequity of rewards received for giving the paw to an experimenter on command in pairs of dogs. We found differences in dogs tested without food reward in the presence of a rewarded partner compared with both a baseline condition (both partners rewarded) and an asocial control situation (no reward, no partner), indicating that the presence of a rewarded partner matters. Furthermore, we showed that it was not the presence of the second dog but the fact that the partner received the food that was responsible for the change in the subjects' behavior. In contrast to primate studies, dogs did not react to differences in the quality of food or effort. Our results suggest that species other than primates show at least a primitive version of inequity aversion, which may be a precursor of a more sophisticated sensitivity to efforts and payoffs of joint interactions.",PNAS,2009,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Their loss has been identified as a major factor contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of top predators is a critical global imperative. Here we review studies of the ecological effects of the dingo Canis lupus dingo, Australia's largest land predator, using this as a case study to explore the influence of a top predator on biodiversity at a continental scale. The dingo was introduced to Australia by people at least 3500 years ago and has an ambiguous status owing to its brief history on the continent, its adverse impacts on livestock production and its role as an ecosystem architect. A large body of research now indicates that dingoes regulate ecological cascades, particularly in arid Australia, and that the removal of dingoes results in an increase in the abundances and impacts of herbivores and invasive mesopredators, most notably the red fox Vulpes vulpes. The loss of dingoes has been linked to widespread losses of small and medium-sized native mammals, the depletion of plant biomass due to the effects of irrupting herbivore populations and increased predation rates by red foxes. We outline a suite of conceptual models to describe the effects of dingoes on vertebrate populations across different Australian environments.

Nine fomites representing porous and nonporous surfaces of different compositions were studied. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, MS2 coliphage, and poliovirus 1 were placed on fomites in 10-Î¼l drops and allowed to dry for 30 min under low (15% to 32%) or high (40% to 65%) relative humidity. Fomite-to-finger transfers were performed using 1.0 kg/cm(2) of pressure for 10 s. Transfer efficiencies were greater under high relative humidity for both porous and nonporous surfaces.

Nonporous surfaces had a greater transfer efficiency (up to 57%) than porous surfaces (<6.8%) under low relative humidity, as well as under high relative humidity (nonporous, up to 79.5%; porous, <13.4%). Transfer efficiency also varied with fomite material and organism type.

It is uncertain whether a cohort or age effect can explain the decline in age-related prevalence, and conflicting evidence exists in favor of the mortality hypothesis. We compared mortality in a subgroup of 118 opposite-handed twin pairs by counting in how many instances the right-handed twin died first.

In the present study, we investigated the in vivo effect of these sulfides on the phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, and elucidated their structure-function relationship. A highly purified form of each sulfide (more than 99% purity) was administered i.p. as a bolus to rats at a concentration of 10 or 100 micromol/kg body weight for 14 consecutive days. As to the phase I enzymes, DAS (100 micromol/kg) slightly but significantly increased cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1 activity (1.6-fold vs. control), whereas DADS and DATS did not affect it or the hepatic total CYP level or CYP1A1/2 activity. With respect to the phase II enzymes, DATS (10 micromol/kg) and DADS at a 10-fold higher dose (100 micromol/kg) significantly increased the activities of glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase, and antioxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase; whereas DAS did not. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury model of rats, either DATS (10 micromol/kg) or DADS (100 micromol/kg) significantly reduced the injury caused by the induction of phase II enzymes with CCl4.

Î”9-THC, the main psychotropic constituent of cannabis, is a CB1 and CB2 receptor partial agonist and in line with classical pharmacology, the responses it elicits appear to be strongly influenced both by the expression level and signalling efficiency of cannabinoid receptors and by ongoing endogenous cannabinoid release. CBD displays unexpectedly high potency as an antagonist of CB1/CB2 receptor agonists in CB1- and CB2-expressing cells or tissues, the manner with which it interacts with CB2 receptors providing a possible explanation for its ability to inhibit evoked immune cell migration. Î”9-THCV behaves as a potent CB2 receptor partial agonist in vitro. In contrast, it antagonizes cannabinoid receptor agonists in CB1-expressing tissues. This it does with relatively high potency and in a manner that is both tissue and ligand dependent.

Given their fundamental role and universal function in the animal kingdom, it makes sense to explore whether space representation and navigation mechanisms are dependent on the species, ecological system, brain structures, or whether they share general and universal properties. One way to explore this issue behaviorally is by domain transfer methodology, where one species is embedded in another speciesâ€™ environment and must cope with an otherwise familiar (in our case, navigation) task. Here we push this idea to the limit by studying the navigation ability of a fish in a terrestrial environment. For this purpose, we trained goldfish to use a Fish Operated Vehicle (FOV), a wheeled terrestrial platform that reacts to the fishâ€™s movement characteristics, location and orientation in its water tank to change the vehicleâ€™s; i.e., the water tankâ€™s, position in the arena. The fish were tasked to â€œdriveâ€ the FOV towards a visual target in the terrestrial environment, which was observable through the walls of the tank, and indeed were able to operate the vehicle, explore the new environment, and reach the target regardless of the starting point, all while avoiding dead-ends and correcting location inaccuracies.

The Great Green Wall programme is a colossal initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded ecosystems across 11 countries in the region, which started in 2007 to also promote sustainable development and climate change mitigation. We evaluated the economic costs and benefits of future land restoration projects under this programme. We applied different scenarios that account for both market-priced and non-market benefits from restored ecosystems and consider the heterogeneity of local decision-making contexts in terms of investment planning horizons, discount rates, and the time needed for the restored ecosystems to start yielding their benefits in full. The results show that every US dollar invested into land restoration yields on average US$1.2 under the base scenario, ranging from US$1.1 to US$4.4 across the scenarios. At most, ten years are needed for land restoration activities to break even from the social perspective, accounting for both market-priced and non-market ecosystem benefits. To fund all proposed land restoration activities, an investment of US$44 billion is needed under the base scenario (US$18â€“70 billion across scenarios). Violent conflicts in the Sahel are estimated to reduce the accessibility to these degraded ecosystems from 27.9 million hectares to 14.1 million hectares. The study highlights activities and locations where land restoration is both economically attractive and ecologically sustainable, even after accounting for lower survival rates of planted trees and grasses, persistence of land degradation drivers and the growing number of violent conflicts hindering land restoration in the Sahel.

Attempts have been made to achieve passive daytime radiative cooling with single-layer paints, but they often require a thick coating or show partial daytime cooling. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate remarkable full-daytime subambient cooling performance with both BaSO4 nanoparticle films and BaSO4 nanocomposite paints. BaSO4 has a high electron band gap for low solar absorptance and phonon resonance at 9 Î¼m for high sky window emissivity.

Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST), the Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3), and the Japanese Meteorological Agencyâ€™s Centennial Observation-Based Estimates of SSTs (COBE-SST) from 2003 to the present. The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07Â° to 0.12Â°C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined.

To assess the effects of antidepressants on reproductive anatomy, physiology, and behavior, adult male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 21 days either to a single concentration of the antidepressants FLX, SER, VEN, or BUP, or to an antidepressant mixture. The data demonstrated that exposure to VEN (305 ng/L and 1104 ng/L) and SER (5.2 ng/L) resulted in mortality. Anatomical alterations were noted within the testes of fish exposed to SER and FLX, both modulators of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Additionally, FLX at 28 ng/L induced vitellogenin in male fish--a common endpoint for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Significant alterations in male secondary sex characteristics were noted with single exposures. Effects of single compound exposures neither carried over, nor became additive in the antidepressant mixtures, and reproductive behavior was not affected. Analysis of brain tissues from the exposed fish suggested increased uptake of FLX, SER and BUP and minimal uptake of VEN when compared to exposure water concentrations. Furthermore, the only metabolite detected consistently in the brain tissues was norfluoxetine. Similar trends of uptake by brain tissue were observed when fish were exposed to antidepressant mixtures. The present study demonstrates that anatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants. The observation that antidepressant uptake into fish tissues is selective may have consequences on assessing the mode-of-action and effects of these compounds in future studies.",Aquatic Toxicology,2011,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

It thus plays a key role in responses to the environment that have a direct bearing on a plant's fitness for adaptation and reproduction. In recent years, there have been major advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating ethylene synthesis and action. Screening for mutants of the triple response phenotype of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings, together with map-based cloning and candidate gene characterization of natural mutants from other plant species, has led to the identification of many new genes for ethylene biosynthesis, signal transduction, and response pathways. The simple chemical nature of ethylene contrasts with its regulatory complexity. This is illustrated by the multiplicity of genes encoding the key ethylene biosynthesis enzymes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and ACC oxidase, multiple ethylene receptors and signal transduction components, and the complexity of regulatory steps involving signalling relays and control of mRNA and protein synthesis and turnover. In addition, there are extensive interactions with other hormones.

In accordance with our hypotheses, we found that conspiracist commenters were more likely to argue against the opposing interpretation and less likely to argue in favor of their own interpretation, while the opposite was true of conventionalist commenters. However, conspiracist comments were more likely to explicitly put forward an account than conventionalist comments were. In addition, conspiracists were more likely to express mistrust and made more positive and fewer negative references to other conspiracy theories. The data also indicate that conspiracists were largely unwilling to apply the â€œconspiracy theoryâ€ label to their own beliefs and objected when others did so, lending support to the long-held suggestion that conspiracy belief carries a social stigma.

These transitions depend on the gravitational influence of other planets, owing to the overlapping of a multiplicity of secular resonances.

Among the known Earth quasi-satellites, it is the closest to our planet and as such, a potentially accessible target for future in situ study. Due to its presumably lengthy dynamical relationship with the Earth and given the fact that at present and for many decades this transient object remains well positioned with respect to our planet, the results of spectroscopic studies of this small body, 26â€“115 m, may be particularly useful to improve our understanding of the origins â€“ local or captured â€“ of Earth's co-orbital asteroid population.

Westoby","An elevated erosional trimline in the heart of West Antarctica in the Ellsworth Mountains tells of thicker ice in the past and represents an important yet ambiguous stage in the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here we analyse the geomorphology of massifs in the southernmost Heritage Range where the surfaces associated with the trimline are overlain by surficial deposits that have the potential to be dated through cosmogenic nuclide analysis. Analysis of 100 rock samples reveals that some clasts have been exposed on glacially moulded surfaces for 1.4 Ma and perhaps more than 3.5 Ma, while others reflect fluctuations in thickness during Quaternary glacial cycles. Modelling the age of the glacially moulded bedrock surface based on cosmogenic 10Be, 26Al and 21Ne concentrations from a depth-profile indicates a minimum exposure age of 2.1â€“2.6 Ma. We conclude that the glacially eroded surfaces adjacent to the trimline predate the Last Glacial Maximum and indeed the Quaternary. Since erosion was by warm-based ice near an ice-sheet upper margin, we suggest it first occurred during the early glaciations of Antarctica before the stepped cooling of the mid-Miocene at âˆ¼14 Ma. This was a time when the interior Antarctic continent had summers warm enough for tundra vegetation to grow and for mountain glaciers to consist of ice at the pressure melting point. During these milder conditions, and subsequently, erosion of glacial troughs is likely to have lowered the ice-sheet surface in relation to the mountains. This means that the range of orbitally induced cyclic fluctuations in ice thickness have progressively been confined to lower elevations.",Earth and Planetary Science Letters,2017,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

In this paper, the HCN version 2 temperature data are described in detail, with a focus on the quality-assured data sources and the systematic bias adjustments. The bias adjustments are discussed in the context of their effect on U.S. temperature trends from the period 1895â€“2007 and in terms of the differences between version 2 and its widely used predecessor (now referred to as HCN version 1). Evidence suggests that the collective effect of changes in observation practice at U.S. HCN stations is systematic and of the same order of magnitude as the background climate signal. For this reason, bias adjustments are essential to reducing the uncertainty in U.S. climate trends. The largest biases in the HCN are shown to be associated with changes to the time of observation and with the widespread changeover from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximumâ€“minimum temperature system (MMTS). With respect to HCN version 1, HCN version 2 trends in maximum temperatures are similar, while minimum temperature trends are somewhat smaller because of 1) an apparent overcorrection in HCN version 1 for the MMTS instrument change and 2) the systematic effect of undocumented station changes, which were not addressed in HCN version 1.",Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,2009,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

INCLUDED STUDIES: The meta-analysis includes all 28 published reports which include specific data on induced abortion and breast cancer incidence. Since some study data are presented in more than one report, the 28 reports were determined to constitute 23 independent studies. Overall induced abortion odds ratios and odds ratios for the different subpopulations were calculated using an average weighted according to the inverse of the variance. An overall unweighted average was also computed for comparison. No quality criteria were imposed, but a narrative review of all included studies is presented for the reader's use in assessing the quality of individual studies. EXCLUDED STUDIES: All 33 published reports including data on abortion and breast cancer incidence but either pertaining only to spontaneous abortion or to abortion without specification as to whether it was induced or spontaneous. These studies are listed for the reader's information. RESULTS: The overall odds ratio (for any induced abortion exposure; n = 21 studies) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval of 1.2, 1.4). For comparison, the unweighted overall odds ratio was 1.4 (1.3,1.6). The odds ratio for nulliparous women was 1.3 (1.0,1.6), that for abortion before the first term pregnancy in parous women was 1.5 (1.2,1.8), and that for abortion after the first term pregnancy was 1.3 (1.1,1.5). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the inclusion of induced abortion among significant independent risk factors for breast cancer, regardless of parity or timing of abortion relative to the first term pregnancy. Although the increase in risk was relatively low, the high incidence of both breast cancer and induced abortion suggest a substantial impact of thousands of excess cases per year currently, and a potentially much greater impact in the next century, as the first cohort of women exposed to legal induced abortion continues to age.",Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,1996,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Subjects: Nine dietary unrestrained male subjects (ages 24Â±5â€…y, body mass index (BMI) 22.7Â±2.1â€…kg/m2, body weight 76.2Â±9.4â€…kg, height 1.83Â±0.06â€…m, 18Â±5% body fat). Results: At 16Â°C (EB), EE (total 24â€…h EE) was increased to 12.9Â±2.0â€…MJ/day as compared to 12.2Â±2.2â€…MJ/day at 22Â°C (P<0.01). The increase was due to increases in sleeping metabolic rate (SMR; the lowest EE during three consecutive hours with hardly any movements as indicated by radar): 7.6Â±0.7 vs 7.2Â±0.7â€…MJ/day (P<0.05) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT; EE-SMR, when activity induced energy expenditure as indicated by radar=0): 1.7Â±0.4 vs 1.0Â±0.4â€…MJ/day (P<0.01). Physical activity level (PAL; EE/SMR) was 1.63â€“1.68. At 16Â°C compared to at 22Â°C, rectal, proximal and distal skin temperatures had decreased (P<0.01). RQ was not different between the two ambient temperature situations. During ad libitum feeding, subjects overate by 32Â±12% (at 22Â°C) and by 34Â±14% (at 16Â°C). Under these circumstances, the decrease of rectal temperature at 16Â°C was attenuated, and inversely related to percentage overeating (r2=0.7; P<0.01). Conclusion: We conclude that at 16Â°C, compared to 22Â°C, energy metabolism was increased, due to increases in SMR and DIT. Overeating under ad libitum circumstances at 16Â°C attenuated the decrease in rectal core body temperature.",European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,2002,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

We examined the effects of NAI on physiological responses, such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) as well as neuronal activity, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus ambiguus (NA), and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) with c-Fos immunohistochemistry in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. In addition, we performed cervical vagotomy to reveal the afferent pathway involved in mediating the effects of NAI on autonomic regulation. NAI significantly decreased BP and HR, and increased HF power of the HRV spectrum. Significant decreases in c-Fos positive nuclei in the PVN and LC, and enhancement of c-Fos expression in the NA and NTS were induced by NAI. After vagotomy, these physiological and neuronal responses to NAI were not observed. These findings suggest that NAI can modulate autonomic regulation through inhibition of neuronal activity in PVN and LC as well as activation of NA neurons, and that these effects of NAI might be mediated via the vagus nerves.",International Journal of Biometeorology,2008,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

We document Britain's sleep based on a nationally representative sample of 1997, 16-93 year olds, who participated in face-to-face interviews. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents reported sleep problems on one or more nights the previous week and 18% reported that the sleep they obtained was insufficient on the majority of nights. Sleep durations were longest in the youngest participants (16-24 years), who slept on average 1 h longer than the 7.04 (SD 1.55) sample average. Sleep duration showed no appreciable change beyond middle age. Men and women reported sleeping similar amounts but women reported more sleep problems. Men reported sleeping less when there were more children in their household. Workers (i.e. employees) reported sleeping less on workdays than on non-workdays, but those based at home and those not employed did not. Inability to switch off from work was related to sleep duration on non-workdays. Across all participants average sleep duration exhibited a non-monotonic association with quality of life (i.e. contribution of sleep to energy, satisfaction and success in work, home and leisure activities). Quality of life was positively associated with sleep duration, for durations up to 9 h, but negatively associated with quality of life beyond this. Comparison of our data with the US national sleep poll revealed that Britain sleeps as little or less, whereas a comparison with data reported 40 years ago revealed no statistically reliable reductions. Although we may not sleep less than four decades ago, when we report sleeping less we also tend to associate that lack of sleep with poor performance and quality of life.",Journal of Sleep Research,2004,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends.

Objective  To estimate the share of net expenditures on insulin captured by manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacies, and health plans from 2014 to 2018. Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study of the US insulin market was conducted in 2020 using 2014-2018 data from multiple sources, including list and estimated net prices from SSR Health for 32 insulin products, mean use weights from a commercial pharmacy claims database, mean acquisition costs and reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mean spread and share of rebates retained by pharmacy benefit managers from state Medicaid and drug transparency reports, and profit margins from the public filings of distribution system participant companies. Participants were insulin manufacturers, drug wholesalers, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, and health plans. Main Outcomes and Measures  Mean list and net insulin prices, mean net expenditures on insulin, share of expenditures retained by each distribution system participant. Results  Between 2014 and 2018, mean list prices of 32 insulin products increased by 40.1% (from $19.60 to $27.45), while mean net prices received by manufacturers decreased by 30.8% (from $10.53 to $7.29). Net expenditures per 100 units of insulin increased by 3.2% (from $15.11 to $15.59) while the share of a hypothetical $100 insulin expenditure accruing to manufacturers decreased by 33.0% (from $69.71 to $46.73) and the share accruing to health plans decreased by 24.7% (from $13.82 to $10.40). The share of insulin expenditures retained by pharmacy benefit managers increased by 154.6% (from $5.64 to $14.36), the share retained by pharmacies increased by 228.8% (from $6.21 to $20.42), and the share retained by wholesalers increased by 74.7% (from $4.63 to $8.09). Conclusions and Relevance  Results of this cross-sectional study of the distribution of insulin expenditures suggest that policies to control insulin costs should consider all entities throughout the insulin distribution system. Manufacturers represented a decreasing share of insulin expenditures, and pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, and wholesalers accounted for a growing share; all entities play a role in increasing insulin costs.",JAMA Health Forum,2021,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,NEI,SUPPORT

However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs. Methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during 2 episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG, were analyzed. Results: The second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the second episode, there was evidence of acute infection including elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. The virus genome from the first episode contained a a stop codon at position 64 of ORF8, leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids. Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the first and second episodes. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020. Conclusions: Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection.

Gibson, Wolfgang Oschmann","With more than 10â€ƒkm of total length, Holocene microbialites in Laguna Bacalar, Mexico, belong to the largest freshwater microbialite occurrences. Microbialites include domes, ledges and oncolites. Domal forms can grow to diameters and heights of 3â€ƒm. Microbialites are composed of low magnesium calcite which is, to a large extent, precipitated due to the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria Homeothrix and Leptolyngbya, and associated diatoms. Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide and triggers carbonate precipitation. Also, an elevated carbonate concentration in lagoon waters, derived from dissolution of Cenozoic limestone in a karst system, supports carbonate precipitation. Trapping and binding of detrital grains is also observed, but is not as common as precipitation. Bacalar microbialites are largely thrombolitic, however, stromatolitic sections occur as well. The bulk of Bacalar microbialites probably formed in the Late Holocene (ca 1â€ƒkyr BP until present). According to 14C dating, microbialites accreted 9 to 8 cal kyr BP; however, these ages may be too old as a result of a strong hard water effect. This effect is seen in 14C ages of living bivalve and gastropod mollusc shells from Bacalar Lagoon, which are 8 to 7 cal kyr BP. The modern associated fauna of microbialites is characterized by low diversity and high abundance of the bivalve mollusc Dreissena sp. and the gastropod Pomacea sp. The abundant grazing gastropods presumably hamper modern microbialite formation. A comparison of Bacalar microbialites with other modern microbialite occurrences worldwide shows only a few patterns: sizes, shapes, microbial taxa, mineralogy, type of accretion and settings including water properties of microbialite occurrences exhibit high variability. A trend may be seen in the grazing metazoa, which are rare to absent in the marine and brackish examples, but apparently present in all the freshwater occurrences of microbialites. Also, freshwater examples are usually characterized by elevated concentrations of carbonate and/or calcium ions in the surrounding waters.",Sedimentology,2008,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Piezoelectric materials are employed in many actuating and sensing applications because they can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Although originally studied in inorganic materials, several biological materials including amino acids and bone, also exhibit piezoelectricity. The exact mechanisms supporting biological piezoelectricity are not known, nor is it known whether biological piezoelectricity conforms strictly to the criteria of classical piezoelectricity. The observation of piezoelectricity in protein crystals presented here links biological piezoelectricity with the classical theory of piezoelectricity. We quantify the direct piezoelectric effect in monoclinic and tetragonal aggregate films of lysozyme using conventional techniques based on the Berlincourt Method. The largest piezoelectric effect measured in a crystalline aggregate film of lysozyme was approximately 6.5â€‰pCâ€‰Nâˆ’1.

The structure of Bk(IO3)3 consists of nine-coordinate BkIII cations that are bridged by iodate anions to yield layers that are isomorphous with those found for AmIII, CfIII, and with lanthanides that possess similar ionic radii. Bk(IO3)4 was expected to adopt the same structure as M(IO3)4 (M = Ce, Np, Pu), but instead parallels the structural chemistry of the smaller ZrIV cation. BkIIIâ€“O and BkIVâ€“O bond lengths are shorter than anticipated and provide further support for a postcurium break in the actinide series. Photoluminescence and absorption spectra collected from single crystals of Bk(IO3)4 show evidence for doping with BkIII in these crystals. In addition to luminescence from BkIII in the Bk(IO3)4 crystals, a broad-band absorption feature is initially present that is similar to features observed in systems with intervalence charge transfer. However, the high-specific activity of 249Bk (t1/2 = 320 d) causes oxidation of BkIII and only BkIV is present after a few days with concomitant loss of both the BkIII luminescence and the broadband feature. The electronic structure of Bk(IO3)3 and Bk(IO3)4 were examined using a range of computational methods that include density functional theory both on clusters and on periodic structures, relativistic ab initio wave function calculations that incorporate spinâ€“orbit coupling (CASSCF), and by a full-model Hamiltonian with spinâ€“orbit coupling and Slaterâ€“Condon parameters (CONDON). Some of these methods provide evidence for an asymmetric ground state present in BkIV that does not strictly adhere to Russelâ€“Saunders coupling and Hundâ€™s Rule even though it possesses a half-filled 5f7 shell. Multiple factors contribute to the asymmetry that include 5f electrons being present in microstates that are not solely spin up, spinâ€“orbit coupling induced mixing of low-lying excited states with the ground state, and covalency in the BkIVâ€“O bonds that distributes the 5f electrons onto the ligands.

Bendick, R. Bilham","Insofar as slip in an earthquake is related to the strain accumulated near a fault since a previous earthquake, and this process repeats many times, the earthquake cycle approximates an autonomous oscillator. Its asymmetric slow accumulation of strain and rapid release is quite unlike the harmonic motion of a pendulum and need not be time predictable, but still resembles a class of repeating systems known as integrate-and-fire oscillators, whose behavior has been shown to demonstrate a remarkable ability to synchronize to either external or self-organized forcing. Given sufficient time and even very weak physical coupling, the phases of sets of such oscillators, with similar though not necessarily identical period, approach each other. Topological and time series analyses presented here demonstrate that earthquakes worldwide show evidence of such synchronization. Though numerous studies demonstrate that the composite temporal distribution of major earthquakes in the instrumental record is indistinguishable from random, the additional consideration of event renewal interval serves to identify earthquake groupings suggestive of synchronization that are absent in synthetic catalogs. We envisage the weak forces responsible for clustering originate from lithospheric strain induced by seismicity itself, by finite strains over teleseismic distances, or by other sources of lithospheric loading such as Earth's variable rotation. For example, quasi-periodic maxima in rotational deceleration are accompanied by increased global seismicity at multidecadal intervals.",Geophysical Research Letters,2017,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

We report the discovery of a new optofluidic principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window. To generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes; the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water. Microscopically, this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity, which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect. The principle of this light-driven flow via ultrasound, that is, photoacoustic streaming by coupling photoacoustics to acoustic streaming, is general and can be applied to any liquid, opening up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming.",Science Advances,2017,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Here, another strategy for improving the kinetics of layered transition metal oxides by the presence of structural water is proposed. To investigate this strategy, the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide, WO3Â·2H2O, is compared with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte. It is found that the presence of structural water leads to a transition from battery-like behavior in the anhydrous WO3 to ideally pseudocapacitive behavior in WO3Â·2H2O. As a result, WO3Â·2H2O exhibits significantly improved capacity retention and energy efficiency for proton storage over WO3 at sweep rates as fast as 200 mV sâ€“1, corresponding to charge/discharge times of just a few seconds. Importantly, the energy storage of WO3Â·2H2O at such rates is nearly 100% efficient, unlike in the case of anhydrous WO3. Pseudocapacitance in WO3Â·2H2O allows for high-mass loading electrodes (>3 mg cmâ€“2) and high areal capacitances (>0.25 F cmâ€“2 at 200 mV sâ€“1) with simple slurry-cast electrodes.

Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5), participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3), age (P = 0.03), sex (P = 1E-3), and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients, independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4), anticholinergics (P = 5E-3), and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, [Tissierellaceae], Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways, including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation. PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies, reveal altered abundance of several taxa, nominate functional pathways, and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome.

Lane, Xiao Cheng Zeng, and Hui Zhao","Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, allow the fabrication of multilayer structures without lattice matching restriction. A central issue in developing such artificial materials is to understand and control the interlayer electron transfer process, which plays a key role in harnessing their emergent properties. Recent photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements revealed that the electron transfer in heterobilayers occurs on ultrafast time scales. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on how this process can be so efficient at van der Waals interfaces. Here we show evidence suggesting the coherent nature of such interlayer electron transfer. In a trilayer of MoS2â€“WS2â€“MoSe2, electrons excited in MoSe2 transfer to MoS2 in about one picosecond. Surprisingly, these electrons do not populate the middle WS2 layer during this process. Calculations showed the coherent nature of the charge transfer and reproduced the measured electron transfer time. The hole transfer from MoS2 to MoSe2 is also found to be efficient and ultrafast. The separation of electrons and holes extends their lifetimes to more than one nanosecond, suggesting potential applications of such multilayer structures in optoelectronics.",Nano Letters,2017,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Here, we report the discovery of a luminous gamma-ray binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud, found with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), from a search for periodic modulation in all sources in the third Fermi LAT catalog. This is the first such system to be found outside the Milky Way. The system has an orbital period of 10.3 days, and is associated with a massive O5III star located in the supernova remnant DEM L241, previously identified as the candidate high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) CXOU J053600.0â€“673507. X-ray and radio emission are also modulated on the 10.3 day period, but are in anti-phase with the gamma-ray modulation. Optical radial velocity measurements suggest that the system contains a neutron star. The source is significantly more luminous than similar sources in the Milky Way, at radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths. The detection of this extra-galactic system, but no new Galactic systems, raises the possibility that the predicted number of gamma-ray binaries in our Galaxy has been overestimated, and that HMXBs may be born containing relatively slowly rotating neutron stars.",The Astrophysical Journal,2016,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

The question of whether SO2 frost on the surface plays a part, and to what degree, in maintaining Io's atmosphere with the constant volcanic outgassing is still debated. It is believed that for a sublimation-supported atmosphere, the primary atmosphere should collapse during eclipses by Jupiter, as the SO2 vapor pressure is strongly coupled to the temperature of the ice on the surface. No direct observations of Io's atmosphere in eclipse have previously been possible, due to the simultaneous need for high spectral and time sensitivity, as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio. Here we present the first ever high-resolution spectra at 19â€‰Âµm of Io's SO2 atmosphere in Jupiter eclipse from the Gemini telescope.

Al-Hashimi","Nucleic acids transiently morph into alternative conformations that can be difficult to characterize at the atomic level by conventional methods because they exist for too little time and in too little abundance. We recently reported evidence for transient Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs in canonical B-DNA based on NMR carbon relaxation dispersion. While the carbon chemical shifts measured for the transient state were consistent with a syn orientation for the purine base, as expected for A(syn)â€¢T(anti) and G(syn)â€¢C+(anti) HG base pairing, HG type hydrogen bonding could only be inferred indirectly. Here, we develop two independent approaches for directly probing transient changes in Nâ€“HÂ·Â·Â·N hydrogen bonds and apply them to the characterization of transient Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA. The first approach takes advantage of the strong dependence of the imino nitrogen chemical shift on hydrogen bonding and involves measurement of R1Ï relaxation dispersion for the hydrogen-bond donor imino nitrogens in G and T residues. In the second approach, we assess the consequence of substituting the hydrogen-bond acceptor nitrogen (N7) with a carbon (C7H7) on both carbon and nitrogen relaxation dispersion data. Together, these data allow us to obtain direct evidence for transient Hoogsteen base pairs that are stabilized by Nâ€“HÂ·Â·Â·N type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA.

Aspects of military control and communication were immediately challenged. Within hours a solar energetic particle event disrupted high-frequency communication in the polar cap. Subsequently, record-setting geomagnetic and ionospheric storms compounded the disruptions.

Agee","The timing and mode of deposition for Martian regolith breccia Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 were determined by combining petrography, shape analysis, and thermochronology. NWA 7034 is composed of igneous, impact, and brecciated clasts within a thermally annealed submicron matrix of pulverized crustal rocks and devitrified impact/volcanic glass. The brecciated clasts are likely lithified portions of Martian regolith with some evidence of past hydrothermal activity. Represented lithologies are primarily ancient crustal materials with crystallization ages as old as 4.4â€‰Ga. One ancient zircon was hosted by an alkali-rich basalt clast, confirming that alkalic volcanism occurred on Mars very early. NWA 7034 is composed of fragmented particles that do not exhibit evidence of having undergone bed load transport by wind or water. The clast size distribution is similar to terrestrial pyroclastic deposits. We infer that the clasts were deposited by atmospheric rainout subsequent to a pyroclastic eruption(s) and/or impact event(s), although the ancient ages of igneous components favor mobilization by impact(s). Despite ancient components, the breccia has undergone a single pervasive thermal event at 500â€“800Â°C, evident by groundmass texture and concordance of ~1.5â€‰Ga dates for bulk rock K-Ar, U-Pb in apatite, and U-Pb in metamict zircons. The 1.5â€‰Ga age is likely a thermal event that coincides with rainout/breccia lithification.

A large amount of malware has been developed and spread such as Soundcomber, Screenmilker, TouchLogger, and so on. In addition, some smartphone attacks are based on physical access to the phone like smudge attacks. All these have reminded current users to pay more attention for smartphone security such as installing anti-malware software to defend against malicious apps, which may reduce the effectiveness of most malware. In this paper, we identify a vulnerability of smartphone charging and design a new type of charging attacks (called juice filming attacks) based on a standard USB connector and HDMI, which can steal users' secrets through automatically video-capturing their inputs (e.g., unlock patterns, PIN code). The efficiency of our designed attacks relies on the observations that users are not aware of any risk when charging their phones in public places and that most users would interact with their phone during the charging. Different from other malware and attacks, our designed juice filming attacks possess six major features: 1) be simple but quite efficient; 2) user unawareness; 3) does not need to install any apps on phone's side; 4) does not need to ask for any permissions; 5) cannot be detected by any current anti-malware software; 6) can be scalable and effective in both Android OS and iOS. To implement this attack, we employ a VGA/RGB frame grabber and further conduct several user studies to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of our attacks.

Strong density variations of spatial scales indicative of gravity waves have previously been identified in this region by using in situ observations. Here we use observations from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) mass spectrometer on Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission to identify such waves in the observations of different atmospheric species. The wave signatures seen in CO2 and Ar are almost identical, whereas the wave signature seen in N2, which is lighter and has a larger scale height, is generally smaller in amplitude and slightly out of phase with those seen in CO2 and Ar. Examination of the observed wave properties in these three species suggests that relatively long vertical wavelength atmospheric gravity waves are the likely source of the waves seen by NGIMS in the upper thermosphere. A two-fluid linear model of the wave perturbations in CO2 and N2 has been used to find the best fit intrinsic wave parameters that match the observed features in these two species. We report the first observationally based estimate of the heating and cooling rates of the Martian thermosphere created by the waves observed in this region. The observed wave density amplitudes are anticorrelated with the background atmospheric temperature. The estimated heating rates show a weak positive correlation with the wave amplitude, whereas the cooling rates show a clearer negative correlation with the wave amplitude.

In addition to dispositional measures of aggressiveness and anger predicting aggressive behaviour and anger in each of the anger-provoking situations, other personality variables were also related to aspects of the road rage response (e.g. conscientiousness, agreeableness, narcissism, and extraversion). Attributions and personality traits accounted for unique variance in the outcomes, and there were only sporadic effects of attributions partially mediating the relationships between personality variables and responses to the anger-provoking situations.

Three distinct symptom patterns are evident based on the descriptive features of reports. The first type is â€˜mass motor hysteriaâ€™ (n = 53) which predominates in nonâ€Western traditional cultures among students exposed to preâ€existing psychosocial stress, most frequently repressive academic and religious discipline, which precipitates dissociation, histrionics, and psychomotor alterations. A second pattern, â€˜mass anxiety hysteriaâ€™ (n = 62), is typified by the sudden appearance of extreme anxiety following the redefinition of a mundane event such as illness in a fellow student or an unfamiliar odour, which is perceived as an immediate threat. A third pattern, â€˜mass pseudoâ€hysteriaâ€™ (n = 1) involves the relabelling of mundane symptoms by hypervigilant authorities. Epidemic hysteria in school settings manifests as variants of a unitary syndrome that is masked by cultural custom and local nomenclature. A diagnosis is reached by noting the absence of a concrete pathogenic etiology, in conjunction with group anxiety, ambiguous, benign, transient symptomatology, and a preponderance of female victims. Management consists of the identification and removal of the precipitating psychosocial stress.",Educational Studies,1996,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

In Australia, dingoes are the mainland apex predator and play an important role in ecological functioning. Currently, however, they are threatened by hybridization with modern domestic dogs in the wild. As a consequence, we explore how increasing our understanding of the evolutionary history of dingoes can inform management and conservation decisions. Previous research on whole mitochondrial genome and nuclear data from five geographical populations showed evidence of two distinct lineages of dingo. Here, we present data from a broader survey of dingoes around Australia using both mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers and investigate the timing of demographic expansions. Biogeographic data corroborate the presence of at least two geographically subdivided genetic populations, southeastern and northwestern. Demographic modeling suggests that dingoes have undergone population expansion in the last 5,000 years. It is not clear whether this stems from expansion into vacant niches after the extinction of thylacines on the mainland or indicates the arrival date of dingoes. Male dispersal is much more common than female, evidenced by more diffuse Y haplogroup distributions. There is also evidence of likely historical male biased introgression from domestic dogs into dingoes, predominately within southeastern Australia. These findings have critical practical implications for the management and conservation of dingoes in Australia; particularly a focus must be placed upon the threatened southeastern dingo population.",Ecology and Evolution,2017,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Here, we explore the mechanisms by which the adult insect head has been able to integrate novel traits and features during its ontogeny, focusing on the cephalic horns of Onthophagus beetles. Specifically, using a microablation approach we investigate how different regions of the dorsal head of adult horned beetles relate to their larval and embryonic counterparts and test whether deeply conserved regional boundaries that establish the embryonic head might also facilitate or bias the positioning of cephalic horns along the dorsal adult head. We find that paired posterior hornsâ€”the most widespread horn type within the genusâ€”are positioned along a border homologous to the embryonic clypeolabral (CL)â€“ocular boundary, and that this placement constitutes the ancestral form of horn positioning. In contrast, we observed that the phylogenetically much rarer anterior horns are positioned by larval head regions contained firmly within the CL segment and away from any major preexisting larval head landmarks or boundaries. Lastly, we describe the unexpected finding that ablations at medial head regions can result in ectopic outgrowths bearing terminal structures resembling the more anterior clypeal ridge.

Participants performed a sustained attention to response task in which they responded to frequent â€œnontargetsâ€ (digits 0â€“9) and withheld responses for infrequent â€œtargetsâ€ (the letter X). Mind wandering was defined both behaviorally, indicated by a failure to withhold a response to a target, and subjectively, via self-report at a thought probe.

Finally, control analysis revealed that the effect of mind wandering on the P300 could not be ascribed to changes in motor activity nor was it associated with general arousal.

B. Ford,"Underwater vocalizations were recorded during repeated encounters with 16 pods, or stable kin groups, of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia. Pods were identified from unique natural markings on individuals. Vocal exchanges within pods were dominated by repetitious, discrete calls. Pods each produced 7â€“17 (mean 10.7) types of discrete calls. Individuals appear to acquire their pod's call repertoire by learning, and repertoires can persist with little change for over 25 years. Call repertoires differed significantly among pods in the resident population. The 16 pods formed four distinct acoustic associations, or clans, each having a unique repertoire of discrete calls, or vocal tradition. Pods within a clan shared several call types, but no sharing took place among clans. Shared calls often contained structural variations specific to each pod or group of pods in the clan. These variants and other differences in acoustic behaviour formed a system of related pod-specific dialects within the vocal tradition of each clan. Pods from different clans often travelled together, but observed patterns of social associations were often independent of acoustic relationships. It is proposed that each clan comprises related pods that have descended from a common ancestral group. New pods formed from this ancestral group through growth and matrilineal division of the lineage. The formation of new pods was accompanied by divergence of the call repertoire of the founding group. Such divergence resulted from the accumulation of errors in call learning across generations, call innovation, and call extinction. Pod-specific repertoires probably serve to enhance the efficiency of vocal communication within the group and act as behavioural indicators of pod affiliation. The striking differences among the vocal traditions of different clans suggest that each is an independent matriline.",Canadian Journal of Zoology,1991,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Surveys have shown that <5 mm plastic particles, known as microplastics, are significantly more abundant in surface seawater and on shorelines than larger plastic particles are. Nevertheless, quantification of microplastics in the environment is hampered by a lack of adequate high-throughput methods for distinguishing and quantifying smaller size fractions (<1 mm), and this has probably resulted in an underestimation of actual microplastic concentrations. Here we present a protocol that allows high-throughput detection and automated quantification of small microplastic particles (20â€“1000 Î¼m) using the dye Nile red, fluorescence microscopy, and image analysis software. This protocol has proven to be highly effective in the quantification of small polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and nylon-6 particles, which frequently occur in the water column. Our preliminary results from sea surface tows show a power-law increase in small microplastics (i.e., <1 mm) with a decreasing particle size. Hence, our data help to resolve speculation about the â€œapparentâ€ loss of this fraction from surface waters.

Even though no functional groups were lost, the extinction event was, however, highly selective against some modes of life, in particular sessile suspension feeders. Although taxa with heavily calcified skeletons suffered higher extinction than other taxa, lightly calcified taxa also appear to have been selected against.

However, they are inherently more difficult to study than their subaerial counterparts due to their inaccessibility. In this study, we use newly acquired 3-D (three-dimensional) seismic reflection data to document the distribution and morphology of 26 ancient, buried lava flows within the middle Eocene-aged Bight Basin Igneous Complex, offshore southern Australia. Many of these lava flows are associated with volcanoes that vary from 60 to 625 m in height and 0.3 to 10 km in diameter. Well data and seismic-stratigraphic relationships suggest that the lava flows and volcanoes were emplaced offshore in water depths of <300 m. The lava flows range from 0.5 to 34 km in length and 1 to 15 km in width and are typified by tabular and dendritic forms. This morphological variation may result from differing lava effusion rates and/or the volumes of lava erupted. We demonstrate that: (1) the dendritic flows contain complex lava distribution systems and kipukas, features never-before observed from seismic data; and (2) the distribution and morphology of the lava flows was strongly controlled by the emplacement of magmatic intrusion-induced forced folds. This suggests that magmatic intrusions may play an important role in controlling the distribution of lava flows elsewhere.

Sallstedt, S. Bengtson, C. Broman, P. M. Crill, D. E.

In the absence of body fossils, emphasis may instead be given to microbially derived features, such as microbialite growth patterns, microbial mat morphologies, and the presence of fossilized gas bubbles in lithified mats. The metabolic affinity of micro-organisms associated with phosphatization may reveal important clues to the nature and accretion of apatite-rich microbialites. Stromatolites from the 1.6 Ga Chitrakoot Formation (Semri Group, Vindhyan Supergroup) in central India contain abundant fossilized bubbles interspersed within fine-grained in situ-precipitated apatite mats with average Î´13Corg indicative of carbon fixation by the Calvin cycle. In addition, the mats hold a synsedimentary fossil biota characteristic of cyanobacterial and rhodophyte morphotypes. Phosphatic oncoid cone-like stromatolites from the Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup (Jhamarkotra Formation) comprise abundant mineralized bubbles enmeshed within tufted filamentous mat fabrics. Construction of these tufts is considered to be the result of filamentous bacteria gliding within microbial mats, and as fossilized bubbles within pristine mat laminae can be used as a proxy for oxygenic phototrophy, this provides a strong indication for cyanobacterial activity in the Aravalli mounds. We suggest that the activity of oxygenic phototrophs may have been significant for the formation of apatite in both Vindhyan and Aravalli stromatolites, mainly by concentrating phosphate and creating steep diurnal redox gradients within mat pore spaces, promoting apatite precipitation. The presence in the Indian stromatolites of alternating apatite-carbonate lamina may result from local variations in pH and oxygen levels caused by photosynthesisâ€“respiration in the mats. Altogether, this study presents new insights into the ecology of ancient phosphatic stromatolites and warrants further exploration into the role of oxygen-producing biotas in the formation of Paleoproterozoic shallow-basin phosphorites.",Geobiology,2018,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT

Primarily known for its crucial role in labour and lactation, a rapidly growing literature suggests that intranasal OT (IN-OT) may also play a role in the emotional and social lives of humans. However, the lack of a convincing theoretical framework explaining the effects of IN-OT that would also allow the prediction of which moderators exert their effects and when has raised healthy skepticism regarding the robustness of human behavioural IN-OT research. Poor knowledge of the exact pharmacokinetic properties of OT, as well as crucial statistical and methodological issues and the absence of direct replication efforts, may have lead to a publication bias in the IN-OT literature, with many unpublished studies with null results remaining buried in laboratory drawers. Is there a file drawer problem in IN-OT research? If this is the case, it may also be true in our own laboratory.

The dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III repeat region that has been extensively studied in connection with human behaviour, is a plausible candidate to contribute to individual differences in political attitudes. A first United States study provisionally identified this gene with political attitude along a liberalâ€“conservative axis albeit contingent upon number of friends. In a large sample of 1771 Han Chinese university students in Singapore, we observed a significant main effect of association between the DRD4 exon III variable number of tandem repeats and political attitude. Subjects with two copies of the 4-repeat allele (4R/4R) were significantly more conservative. Our results provided evidence for a role of the DRD4 gene variants in contributing to individual differences in political attitude particularly in females and more generally suggested that associations between individual genes, and neurochemical pathways, contributing to traits relevant to the social sciences can be provisionally identified.",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,2015,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

White and Mary Beth Hall,"As a major contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it has been suggested that reducing animal agriculture or consumption of animal-derived foods may reduce GHGs and enhance food security. Because the total removal of animals provides the extreme boundary to potential mitigation options and requires the fewest assumptions to model, the yearly nutritional and GHG impacts of eliminating animals from US agriculture were quantified. Animal-derived foods currently provide energy (24% of total), protein (48%), essential fatty acids (23â€“100%), and essential amino acids (34â€“67%) available for human consumption in the United States. The US livestock industry employs 1.6 Ã— 106 people and accounts for $31.8 billion in exports. Livestock recycle more than 43.2 Ã— 109 kg of human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts, converting them into human-edible food, pet food, industrial products, and 4 Ã— 109 kg of N fertilizer. Although modeled plants-only agriculture produced 23% more food, it met fewer of the US populationâ€™s requirements for essential nutrients. When nutritional adequacy was evaluated by using least-cost diets produced from foods available, more nutrient deficiencies, a greater excess of energy, and a need to consume a greater amount of food solids were encountered in plants-only diets. In the simulated system with no animals, estimated agricultural GHG decreased (28%), but did not fully counterbalance the animal contribution of GHG (49% in this model). This assessment suggests that removing animals from US agriculture would reduce agricultural GHG emissions, but would also create a food supply incapable of supporting the US populationâ€™s nutritional requirements.",PNAS,2017,CONTRADICT,SUPPORT,CONTRADICT,CONTRADICT

Nineteen studies examined meat subtypes (5 beef, 5 pork, 2 lamb, 1 veal and 19 poultry) and associations with colorectal, colon or rectal cancer risk and 4 studies examined associations with adenoma risk (1 beef and 4 poultry). Comparing highest versus lowest intake, beef consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.11, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.01 to 1.22) and colon cancer (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.24, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.07 to 1.44), but no association was found with rectal cancer (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.95, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.78 to 1.16).

Although natural mechanisms contributing to this positive climateâ€“carbon feedback have been evaluated using Earth system models, analogous feedbacks involving human activities have not been systematically quantified. Here we conceptualize and estimate the magnitude of several economic mechanisms that generate a carbonâ€“climate feedback, using the Kaya identity to separate a net economic feedback into components associated with population, GDP, heating and cooling, and the carbon intensity of energy production and transportation. We find that climate-driven decreases in economic activity (GDP) may in turn decrease human energy use and thus fossil fuel CO2 emissions. In a high radiative forcing scenario, such decreases in economic activity reduce fossil fuel emissions by 13% this century, lowering atmospheric CO2 by over 100 ppm in 2100. The natural carbonâ€“climate feedback, in contrast, increases atmospheric CO2 over this period by a similar amount, and thus, the net effect including both feedbacks is nearly zero. Our work highlights the importance of improving the representation of climateâ€“economic feedbacks in scenarios of future change. Although the effects of climate warming on the economy may offset weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, a loss of economic productivity will have high societal costs, potentially increasing wealth inequity and limiting resources available for effective adaptation.",PNAS,2018,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

We use sedimentary charcoal accumulation rates to construct long-term variations in fire during the past 3,000 y in the American West and compare this record to independent fire-history data from historical records and fire scars. There has been a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400â€“1700 CE [Common Era]). Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 950â€“1250 CE) and during the 1800s. Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE. Since the late 1800s, human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline. Consequently, there is now a forest â€œfire deficitâ€ in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecological, and climate changes.

We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000â€“2015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (>1 Ïƒ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for âˆ¼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984â€“2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.",PNAS,2016,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

This framework may explain hallucinations and delusions. Here, we characterized the balance between visual bottom-up and top-down processing in people with early psychosis (study 1) and in psychosis-prone, healthy individuals (study 2) to elucidate the mechanisms that might contribute to the emergence of psychotic experiences. Through a specialized mental-health service, we identified unmedicated individuals who experience early psychotic symptoms but fall below the threshold for a categorical diagnosis.

In the complementary study, we capitalized on subtle variations in perception and belief in the general population that exhibit graded similarity with psychotic experiences (schizotypy). We observed that the degree of psychosis proneness in healthy individuals, and, specifically, the presence of subtle perceptual alterations, is also associated with stronger reliance on prior knowledge. Although, in the current experimental studies, this shift conferred a performance benefit, under most natural viewing situations, it may provoke anomalous perceptual experiences.

In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching accuracy for self-selected and other-selected high-likeness images. Surprisingly, images selected by previously unfamiliar viewers â€“ after very limited exposure to a target face â€“ were more accurately matched than self-selected images chosen by the target identity themselves. Results also revealed extremely low inter-rater agreement in ratings of likeness across participants, suggesting that perceptions of image resemblance are inherently unstable. In Experiment 2, we test whether the cost of self-selection can be explained by this general disagreement in likeness judgments between individual raters. We find that averaging across rankings by multiple raters produces image selections that provide superior identification accuracy.

Here we present a proof of concept for a genetic strategy that aims to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics and selectively kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We use temperate phages to deliver a functional clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)â€“CRISPR-associated (Cas) system into the genome of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The delivered CRISPR-Cas system destroys both antibiotic resistance-conferring plasmids and genetically modified lytic phages. This linkage between antibiotic sensitization and protection from lytic phages is a key feature of the strategy. It allows programming of lytic phages to kill only antibiotic-resistant bacteria while protecting antibiotic-sensitized bacteria. Phages designed according to this strategy may be used on hospital surfaces and hand sanitizers to facilitate replacement of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with sensitive ones.,PNAS,2015,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Duffy, and Charles A. Czeisler","In the past 50 y, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality, with adverse consequences on general health. A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelengthâ€“enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.",PNAS,2014,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT

Developing CR mimetics, compounds that reproduce the longevity benefits of CR without its side effects, is of widespread interest. Here, we employed the Connectivity Map to identify drugs with overlapping gene expression profiles with CR. Eleven statistically significant compounds were predicted as CR mimetics using this bioinformatics approach. We then tested rapamycin, allantoin, trichostatin A, LY-294002 and geldanamycin in Caenorhabditis elegans. An increase in lifespan and healthspan was observed for all drugs except geldanamycin when fed to wild-type worms, but no lifespan effects were observed in eat-2 mutant worms, a genetic model of CR, suggesting that life-extending effects may be acting via CR-related mechanisms. We also treated daf-16 worms with rapamycin, allantoin or trichostatin A, and a lifespan extension was observed, suggesting that these drugs act via DAF-16-independent mechanisms, as would be expected from CR mimetics. Supporting this idea, an analysis of predictive targets of the drugs extending lifespan indicates various genes within CR and longevity networks. We also assessed the transcriptional profile of worms treated with either rapamycin or allantoin and found that both drugs use several specific pathways that do not overlap, indicating different modes of action for each compound. The current work validates the capabilities of this bioinformatic drug repositioning method in the context of longevity and reveals new putative CR mimetics that warrant further studies.",Aging Cell,2015,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT,SUPPORT
