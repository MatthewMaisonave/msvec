Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. In the 1920s and 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife developed special microscopes.
1. Using these he claimed he could visualize living microorganisms, including viruses too small to be seen with any other existing technology, via the color of auras emitted as they vibrated (Citation1).
2. In a 1961 deposition he explained this as follows: “A special risley prism which works on a counter rotation principle selects a portion of the light frequency which illuminates these viruses in their own characteristic chemical colors by emission of coordinative light frequency and the viruses become readily identifiable by the colors revealed on observation.” (Citation2).
3. Several of his microscopes still exist.
4. Their principles and alleged function have never been validated, and they have never been adopted for use.
5. Rife went on to postulate that the microorganisms he was seeing were involved in human diseases, including cancer (Citation3–6).
6. He invented a machine that he claimed could transmit radio frequency energy into a person and vibrate these microorganisms at a “mortal oscillatory rate”, thereby killing them and improving the disease they were causing (Citation3–6).
7. Rife's claims were based upon his microscopic evaluations, which again do not appear to be legitimate.
8. The very concept that diseases can be cured by radio frequency energy, originally proposed by Albert Abrams and referred to as ‘radionics’ (Citation7), was later investigated and disproven by the Scientific American (Citation7,Citation8).
9. Nonetheless, there remain those who believe in Rife's work, claim it was suppressed as part of an elaborate conspiracy (Citation9) and continue to sell similar energy-transmitting devices (Citation10–12).
10. Here, on behalf of PALS who asked about it, we review the potential use of the Rife Machine for ALS.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Planning a response to an outbreak of a pandemic strain of influenza is a high public health priority.
1. Three research groups using different individual-based, stochastic simulation models have examined the consequences of intervention strategies chosen in consultation with U.S. public health workers.
2. The first goal is to simulate the effectiveness of a set of potentially feasible intervention strategies.
3. Combinations called targeted layered containment (TLC) of influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis and nonpharmaceutical interventions of quarantine, isolation, school closure, community social distancing, and workplace social distancing are considered.
4. The second goal is to examine the robustness of the results to model assumptions.
5. The comparisons focus on a pandemic outbreak in a population similar to that of Chicago, with ≈8.6 million people.
6. The simulations suggest that at the expected transmissibility of a pandemic strain, timely implementation of a combination of targeted household antiviral prophylaxis, and social distancing measures could substantially lower the illness attack rate before a highly efficacious vaccine could become available.
7. Timely initiation of measures and school closure play important roles.
8. Because of the current lack of data on which to base such models, further field research is recommended to learn more about the sources of transmission and the effectiveness of social distancing measures in reducing influenza transmission.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. World over, potatoes are being stored at 8–12 °C (85–90 % RH).
1. This is the most common way of long-term (up to 6 to 9 months) storage of potatoes.
2. The benefit of storing the potatoes within the temperature range of 8–12 °C is minimum accumulation of sugars in stored potato tubers.
3. In sub-temperate, sub-tropical and tropical countries of the world, short-term (3 to 4 months) storage of potatoes is being done by non-refrigerated traditional/on-farm methods.
4. These short- and long-term storage methods keep the stored potatoes suitable not only for table purpose but also for processing.
5. However, once the natural dormancy period of potato is over, the prevailing temperatures in these storage methods favour sprouting and sprout growth.
6. Therefore, use of some sprout suppressant to check the sprout growth becomes essential under these methods of potato storage.
7. CIPC [Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is the most wide spread and commonly used sprout suppressant on potatoes.
8. CIPC has been in use for more than 50 years and research carried out over such a long period use of CIPC has not only enhanced our understanding of its properties and chemistry but also about the production and toxicological status of its metabolites/degradation products.
9. Today, various safety issues and concerns have surfaced primarily due to continuous and long-term use of CIPC.
10. This review presents an appraisal on CIPC and explains the reasons for the long-time dependence on this chemical as a potato sprout suppressant.
11. Issues like maximum residue limit and acceptable daily intake limit are being discussed for CIPC.
12. This article brings an update on practical aspects of potato storage, residue levels of CIPC, efficacy of CIPC as sprout suppressant and health and environmental safety issues linked with CIPC and its metabolites.
13. The aim of this article is to find possible solutions, way outs and future plans that can make the sprout suppression of potatoes safer and more risk free.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancer (KSC) are the most common types of cancer in White-skinned populations.
1. Both tumor entities showed increasing incidence rates worldwide but stable or decreasing mortality rates.
2. Rising incidence rates of cutaneous melanoma (CM) and KSC are largely attributed to increasing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the main causal risk factor for skin cancer.
3. Incidence rates of KSC, comprising of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are much higher than that of melanoma.
4. BCC development is mainly the cause of an intensive UV exposure in childhood and adolescence, while SCC development is related to chronic, cumulative UV exposure over decades.
5. Although mortality is relatively low, KSC is an increasing problem for health care services causing significant morbidity.
6. Cutaneous melanoma is rapidly increasing in White populations, with an estimated annual increase of around 3–7% over the past decades.
7. In contrast to SCC, melanoma risk is associated with intermittent and chronic exposure to sunlight.
8. The frequency of its occurrence is closely associated with the constitutive color of the skin and the geographical zone.
9. Changes in outdoor activities and exposure to sunlight during the past 70 years are an important factor for the increasing incidence of melanoma.
10. Mortality rates of melanoma show stabilization in the USA, Australia, and in European countries.
11. In the USA even dropping numbers of death cases were recently reported, probably reflecting efficacy of the new systemic treatments.
12. Among younger cohorts in some populations (e.g., Australia and New Zealand,), stabilizing or declining incidence rates of CM are observed, potentially caused by primary prevention campaigns aimed at reducing UV exposure.
13. In contrast, incidence rates of CM are still rising in most European countries and in the USA.
14. Ongoing trends towards thinner melanoma are largely ascribed to earlier detection.

Experts told Reuters that while it is true that some masks could shed microplastics, it is unknown whether there is a risk posed to humans. Moreover, the article being cited does not mentioned face masks and one of the studies mentioned began data collection prior to the pandemic. Some face coverings can help reduce the inhalation of non-mask microplastics, and it is widely agreed that the risks outweigh the benefits of protecting people against COVID-19.
Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Wearing face masks has become the new normal worldwide due to the global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019.
1. The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported.
2. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk.
3. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested.
4. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h).
5. N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk.
6. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation.
7. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint.
8. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.

0. The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) was identified as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization.
1. The virus spreads primarily through saliva droplets or nasal discharges, in addition to coughing or sneezing from an infected person.
2. The most common symptom at the onset of illness is fever, which may appear within 2–14 days after exposure.
3. The high fever (above 38 °C) can persist from one to 4 days.
4. The febrile illness usually has a variable negative impact on sperm characteristics such as sperm output, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation.
5. These defects proliferated due to an increase in testicular temperature, and disturbance in the thermoregulatory systems that are responsible for the testicular heat loss.
6. Coronavirus studies suggest that fever from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induces a reversible negative effect on the sperm parameters until one cycle (74 days) of spermatogenesis.
7. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 can have long-term adverse effects on testicles via immune or inflammatory reactions after the patient has fully recovered.
8. This evidence could be added to the list of the long-term post-COVID-19 syndromes.
9. Long-term follow-up and evaluation of the sperm parameters are necessary for all recovered male patients, especially the young ones.

Social media users revived an already debunked claim that the Milankovitch Cycles - Earth’s slight shifting of position relative to the sun over geological time - can disprove anthropogenic climate change.
Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The geologic record of Milankovitch climate cycles provides a rich conceptual and temporal framework for evaluating Earth system evolution, bestowing a sharp lens through which to view our planet’s history.
1. However, the utility of these cycles for constraining the early Earth system is hindered by seemingly insurmountable uncertainties in our knowledge of solar system behavior (including Earth–Moon history), and poor temporal control for validation of cycle periods (e.g., from radioisotopic dates).
2. Here we address these problems using a Bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively link astronomical theory with geologic observation, allowing a reconstruction of Proterozoic astronomical cycles, fundamental frequencies of the solar system, the precession constant, and the underlying geologic timescale, directly from stratigraphic data.
3. Application of the approach to 1.4-billion-year-old rhythmites indicates a precession constant of 85.79 ± 2.72 arcsec/year (2σ), an Earth–Moon distance of 340,900 ± 2,600 km (2σ), and length of day of 18.68 ± 0.25 hours (2σ), with dominant climatic precession cycles of ∼14 ky and eccentricity cycles of ∼131 ky.
4. The results confirm reduced tidal dissipation in the Proterozoic.
5. A complementary analysis of Eocene rhythmites (∼55 Ma) illustrates how the approach offers a means to map out ancient solar system behavior and Earth–Moon history using the geologic archive.
6. The method also provides robust quantitative uncertainties on the eccentricity and climatic precession periods, and derived astronomical timescales.
7. As a consequence, the temporal resolution of ancient Earth system processes is enhanced, and our knowledge of early solar system dynamics is greatly improved.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Sea ice is the frozen portion of the polar oceans1, covering roughly 3 to 6% of the Earth's surface area at any given time (Comiso, 2010).
1. The Earth hosts major sea ice systems at both poles: one in the Arctic Ocean and another in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, which is referred to here simply as Antarctic sea ice.
2. Ice forms in the local autumn/winter and melts in local spring/summer, driven by exchanges of heat between the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere.
3. Sea ice is typically bright – snow-covered ice can reflect away more than 80% of incoming solar radiation.
4. As sea ice melts, it exposes the darker (less reflective) water beneath it, and the planet's surface becomes darker and warmer overall.
5. By this mechanism, changes in sea ice can amplify changes in the climate system (e.g.
6. warming leads to melt, exposing darker surfaces, which leads to additional absorption of incoming sunlight and therefore more melt).
7. In addition to its direct relevance for climate, sea ice has a large impact on ocean biology and serves as a home and/or hunting ground for some large animals, such as polar bears in the Arctic Ocean and emperor penguins around Antarctica.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The frequency, intensity, and spatial scale of climate extremes are changing rapidly due to anthropogenic global warming.1,2 A growing research challenge is to understand how multiple climate-driven disturbances interact with each other over multi-decadal time frames, generating combined effects that cannot be predicted from single events alone.3, 4, 5 Here we examine the emergent dynamics of five coral bleaching events along the 2,300 km length of the Great Barrier Reef that affected >98% of the Reef between 1998 and 2020.
1. We show that the bleaching responses of corals to a given level of heat exposure differed in each event and were strongly influenced by contingency and the spatial overlap and strength of interactions between events.
2. Naive regions that escaped bleaching for a decade or longer were the most susceptible to bouts of heat exposure.
3. Conversely, when pairs of successive bleaching episodes were close together (1–3 years apart), the thermal threshold for severe bleaching increased because the earlier event hardened regions of the Great Barrier Reef to further impacts.
4. In the near future, the biological responses to recurrent bleaching events may become stronger as the cumulative geographic footprint expands further, potentially impairing the stock-recruitment relationships among lightly and severely bleached reefs with diverse recent histories.
5. Understanding the emergent properties and collective dynamics of recurrent disturbances will be critical for predicting spatial refuges and cumulative ecological responses, and for managing the longer-term impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems.

0. Reports of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination have emerged.
1. To evaluate the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by vaccine product, vaccination dose number, sex, and age.
2. Four cohort studies were conducted according to a common protocol, and the results were combined using meta-analysis.
3. Participants were 23 122 522 residents aged 12 years or older.
4. They were followed up from December 27, 2020, until incident myocarditis or pericarditis, censoring, or study end (October 5, 2021).
5. Data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, hospital diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis, and covariates for the participants were obtained from linked nationwide health registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
6. The 28-day risk periods after administration date of the first and second doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, including BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and AZD1222 or combinations thereof.
7. A homologous schedule was defined as receiving the same vaccine type for doses 1 and 2.
8. Incident outcome events were defined as the date of first inpatient hospital admission based on primary or secondary discharge diagnosis for myocarditis or pericarditis from December 27, 2020, onward.
9. Secondary outcome was myocarditis or pericarditis combined from either inpatient or outpatient hospital care.
10. Poisson regression yielded adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and excess rates with 95% CIs, comparing rates of myocarditis or pericarditis in the 28-day period following vaccination with rates among unvaccinated individuals.
11. Among 23 122 522 Nordic residents (81% vaccinated by study end; 50.2% female), 1077 incident myocarditis events and 1149 incident pericarditis events were identified.
12. Within the 28-day period, for males and females 12 years or older combined who received a homologous schedule, the second dose was associated with higher risk of myocarditis, with adjusted IRRs of 1.75 (95% CI, 1.43-2.14) for BNT162b2 and 6.57 (95% CI, 4.64-9.28) for mRNA-1273.
13. Among males 16 to 24 years of age, adjusted IRRs were 5.31 (95% CI, 3.68-7.68) for a second dose of BNT162b2 and 13.83 (95% CI, 8.08-23.68) for a second dose of mRNA-1273, and numbers of excess events were 5.55 (95% CI, 3.70-7.39) events per 100 000 vaccinees after the second dose of BNT162b2 and 18.39 (9.05-27.72) events per 100 000 vaccinees after the second dose of mRNA-1273.
14. Estimates for pericarditis were similar.
15. Results of this large cohort study indicated that both first and second doses of mRNA vaccines were associated with increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.
16. For individuals receiving 2 doses of the same vaccine, risk of myocarditis was highest among young males (aged 16-24 years) after the second dose.
17. These findings are compatible with between 4 and 7 excess events in 28 days per 100 000 vaccinees after BNT162b2, and between 9 and 28 excess events per 100 000 vaccinees after mRNA-1273.
18. This risk should be balanced against the benefits of protecting against severe COVID-19 disease.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low indoor relative humidity, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract.
1. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, in which supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air.
2. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%.
3. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.
4. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred.
5. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity.
6. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission.
7. This potential therapeutical use should be studied further.

3. We partition the total uncertainty into the individual contributions caused by glacier models, general circulation models, RCPs, and natural variability.
4. We find that emission scenario uncertainty is growing throughout the 21st century and is the largest source of uncertainty by 2100.
5. The relative importance of glacier model uncertainty decreases over time, but it is the greatest source of uncertainty until the middle of this century.
6. The projection uncertainty associated with natural variability is small on the global scale but can be large on regional scales.
7. The projected global mass loss by 2100 relative to 2015 (79 ± 56 mm sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, 159 ± 86 mm sea level equivalent for RCP8.5) is lower than, but well within, the uncertainty range of previous projections.

0. The 837 km New York City shoreline is lined by significant economic assets and dense population vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding.
1. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New York City developed a comprehensive plan to mitigate future climate risks, drawing upon the scientific expertise of the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), a special advisory group comprised of university and private-sector experts.
2. This paper highlights current NPCC findings regarding sea level rise and coastal flooding, with some of the City’s ongoing and planned responses.
3. Twentieth century sea level rise in New York City (2.8 cm/decade) exceeded the global average (1.7 cm/decade), underscoring the enhanced regional risk to coastal hazards.
4. NPCC (2015) projects future sea level rise at the Battery of 28–53 cm by the 2050s and 46–99 cm by the 2080s, relative to 2000–2004 (mid-range, 25th–75th percentile).
5. High-end SLR estimates (90th percentile) reach 76 cm by the 2050s, and 1.9 m by 2100.
6. Combining these projections with updated FEMA flood return period curves, assuming static flood dynamics and storm behavior, flood heights for the 100-year storm (excluding waves) attain 3.9–4.5 m (mid-range), relative to the NAVD88 tidal datum, and 4.9 m (high end) by the 2080s, up from 3.4 m in the 2000s.
7. Flood heights with a 1% annual chance of occurrence in the 2000s increase to 2.0–5.4% (mid-range) and 12.7% per year (high-end), by the 2080s.
8. Guided by NPCC (2013, 2015) findings, New York City has embarked on a suite of initiatives to strengthen coastal defenses, employing various approaches tailored to specific neighborhood needs.
9. NPCC continues its collaboration with the city to investigate vulnerability to extreme climate events, including heat waves, inland floods and coastal storms.
10. Current research entails higher-resolution neighborhood-level coastal flood mapping, changes in storm characteristics, surge height interactions with sea level rise, and stronger engagement with stakeholders and community-based organizations.

0. Regime shifts can abruptly affect hydrological, climatic and terrestrial systems, leading to degraded ecosystems and impoverished societies.
1. While the frequency of regime shifts is predicted to increase, the fundamental relationships between the spatial-temporal scales of shifts and their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
2. Here we analyse empirical data from terrestrial (n = 4), marine (n = 25) and freshwater (n = 13) environments and show positive sub-linear empirical relationships between the size and shift duration of systems.
3. Each additional unit area of an ecosystem provides an increasingly smaller unit of time taken for that system to collapse, meaning that large systems tend to shift more slowly than small systems but disproportionately faster.
4. We substantiate these findings with five computational models that reveal the importance of system structure in controlling shift duration.
5. The findings imply that shifts in Earth ecosystems occur over ‘human’ timescales of years and decades, meaning the collapse of large vulnerable ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest and Caribbean coral reefs, may take only a few decades once triggered.

0. Geological evidence suggests that during a future eruption, Cumbre Vieja Volcano on the Island of La Palma may experience a catastrophic failure of its west flank, dropping 150 to 500 km³ of rock into the sea.
1. Using a geologically reasonable estimate of landslide motion, we model tsunami waves produced by such a collapse.
2. Waves generated by the run-out of a 500 km³ (150 km³) slide block at 100 m/s could transit the entire Atlantic Basin and arrive on the coasts of the Americas with 10–25 m (3–8 m) height.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Oil source rocks represent sequences with the Corg content ranging from 3–5 to 15–20%.
1. Sedimentary sections of large petroliferous basins usually include one or two such sequences, which generated liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons (HCs) during their long-term subsidence to the elevated temperature zone.
2. The middle episode of the Late Cretaceous was marked by the accumulation of sediments with a high Corg content in different areas of the World Ocean.
3. However, truly unique settings favorable for accumulation of the sapropelic organic matter (OM) appeared at continental margins that primarily faced the Tethys Ocean.
4. The La Luna Formation is one of the best known source rock sequences responsible for the generation of liquid HCs in basins of the Caribbean region.
5. In the Persian Gulf, the Kazhdumi Formation composed of marls and clayey limestones is considered the main oil-generating sequence.
6. In the Paleogene after closure of the Tethys, the Pacific continental margins became the main domains that accumulated source rocks.
7. The maximal deposition of sapropelic OM in this region corresponded to the early-middle Eocene.
8. In the Neogene, the accumulation of source sediments was associated with deltas and submarine fans of large rivers and with upwelling zones.
9. In basins of the Californian borderland, the main oil-generating sequences are represented by siliceous rocks of the Monterey Formation.
10. They were deposited in a regional upwelling zone related to the cold California Current.

0. Prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery from COVID-19, but some of these patients do not appear to shed infectious virus.
1. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients.
2. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells.
3. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism.
4. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral–host chimeric transcripts.
5. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery.
6. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3′ end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

0. Billions of nocturnally migrating birds move through increasingly photopolluted skies, relying on cues for navigation and orientation that artificial light at night (ALAN) can impair.
1. However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas.
2. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum’s “Tribute in Light” in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations.
3. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km.
4. We estimate that the installation influenced ≈1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y.
5. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently.
6. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each year’s observations.
7. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds.
8. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.

0. ‘The dress’ is a peculiar photograph: by themselves the dress’ pixels are brown and blue, colors associated with natural illuminants [1], but popular accounts (#TheDress) suggest the dress appears either white/gold or blue/black [2].
1. Could the purported categorical perception arise because the original social-media question was an alternative-forced-choice?
2. In a free-response survey (N = 1401), we found that most people, including those naïve to the image, reported white/gold or blue/black, but some said blue/brown.
3. Reports of white/gold over blue/black were higher among older people and women.
4. On re-test, some subjects reported a switch in perception, showing the image can be multistable.
5. In a language-independent measure of perception, we asked subjects to identify the dress’ colors from a complete color gamut.
6. The results showed three peaks corresponding to the main descriptive categories, providing additional evidence that the brain resolves the image into one of three stable percepts.
7. We hypothesize that these reflect different internal priors: some people favor a cool illuminant (blue sky), discount shorter wavelengths, and perceive white/gold; others favor a warm illuminant (incandescent light), discount longer wavelengths, and see blue/black.
8. The remaining subjects may assume a neutral illuminant, and see blue/brown.
9. We show that by introducing overt cues to the illumination, we can flip the dress color.

1. However, the increased sensitivity is in many ways a double-edged sword as background contaminating DNA generated during the manufacture of consumables and sampling devices is now being detected and may compromise the interpretation of the DNA profile results.
2. This study initially demonstrated the effectiveness of ethylene oxide (EO) as a post-production treatment to eliminate DNA on swabs, used as a sampling device for the recovery of cellular material.
3. Subsequently, the potential adverse effects of any residual EO remaining on the swabs on the downstream DNA analysis on both rayon and cotton swabs were investigated and the levels of remaining EO measured.
4. Two main variables were tested: the amount of time elapsed since EO treatment of the swabs prior to use, and the time elapsed between cellular material collection and DNA analysis.
5. Residual levels of EO were found to be below quantitation levels and therefore also international standards.
6. The results indicated that while there was a negligible effect of EO treatment on DNA recovered from rayon swabs, there was however an adverse effect on the DNA profiles recovered from cotton swabs.
7. The adverse effect was negatively correlated with time since EO treatment and positively correlated with time to DNA analysis.

0. With more than 10 km of total length, Holocene microbialites in Laguna Bacalar, Mexico, belong to the largest freshwater microbialite occurrences.
1. Microbialites include domes, ledges and oncolites.
2. Domal forms can grow to diameters and heights of 3 m. Microbialites are composed of low magnesium calcite which is, to a large extent, precipitated due to the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria Homeothrix and Leptolyngbya, and associated diatoms.
3. Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide and triggers carbonate precipitation.
4. Also, an elevated carbonate concentration in lagoon waters, derived from dissolution of Cenozoic limestone in a karst system, supports carbonate precipitation.
5. Trapping and binding of detrital grains is also observed, but is not as common as precipitation.
6. Bacalar microbialites are largely thrombolitic, however, stromatolitic sections occur as well.
7. The bulk of Bacalar microbialites probably formed in the Late Holocene (ca 1 kyr BP until present).
8. According to 14C dating, microbialites accreted 9 to 8 cal kyr BP; however, these ages may be too old as a result of a strong hard water effect.
9. This effect is seen in 14C ages of living bivalve and gastropod mollusc shells from Bacalar Lagoon, which are 8 to 7 cal kyr BP.
10. The modern associated fauna of microbialites is characterized by low diversity and high abundance of the bivalve mollusc Dreissena sp.
11. and the gastropod Pomacea sp.
12. The abundant grazing gastropods presumably hamper modern microbialite formation.
13. A comparison of Bacalar microbialites with other modern microbialite occurrences worldwide shows only a few patterns: sizes, shapes, microbial taxa, mineralogy, type of accretion and settings including water properties of microbialite occurrences exhibit high variability.
14. A trend may be seen in the grazing metazoa, which are rare to absent in the marine and brackish examples, but apparently present in all the freshwater occurrences of microbialites.
15. Also, freshwater examples are usually characterized by elevated concentrations of carbonate and/or calcium ions in the surrounding waters.

0. The reaction of 249Bk(OH)4 with iodate under hydrothermal conditions results in the formation of Bk(IO3)3 as the major product with trace amounts of Bk(IO3)4 also crystallizing from the reaction mixture.
1. The structure of Bk(IO3)3 consists of nine-coordinate BkIII cations that are bridged by iodate anions to yield layers that are isomorphous with those found for AmIII, CfIII, and with lanthanides that possess similar ionic radii.
2. Bk(IO3)4 was expected to adopt the same structure as M(IO3)4 (M = Ce, Np, Pu), but instead parallels the structural chemistry of the smaller ZrIV cation.
3. BkIII–O and BkIV–O bond lengths are shorter than anticipated and provide further support for a postcurium break in the actinide series.
4. Photoluminescence and absorption spectra collected from single crystals of Bk(IO3)4 show evidence for doping with BkIII in these crystals.
5. In addition to luminescence from BkIII in the Bk(IO3)4 crystals, a broad-band absorption feature is initially present that is similar to features observed in systems with intervalence charge transfer.
6. However, the high-specific activity of 249Bk (t1/2 = 320 d) causes oxidation of BkIII and only BkIV is present after a few days with concomitant loss of both the BkIII luminescence and the broadband feature.
7. The electronic structure of Bk(IO3)3 and Bk(IO3)4 were examined using a range of computational methods that include density functional theory both on clusters and on periodic structures, relativistic ab initio wave function calculations that incorporate spin–orbit coupling (CASSCF), and by a full-model Hamiltonian with spin–orbit coupling and Slater–Condon parameters (CONDON).
8. Some of these methods provide evidence for an asymmetric ground state present in BkIV that does not strictly adhere to Russel–Saunders coupling and Hund’s Rule even though it possesses a half-filled 5f7 shell.
9. Multiple factors contribute to the asymmetry that include 5f electrons being present in microstates that are not solely spin up, spin–orbit coupling induced mixing of low-lying excited states with the ground state, and covalency in the BkIV–O bonds that distributes the 5f electrons onto the ligands.
10. These factors are absent or diminished in other f7 ions such as GdIII or CmIII.

1. Here, we explore the possibility that choices can seem to occur before they are actually made.
2. In two studies, participants were asked to quickly choose from a set of options before a randomly selected option was made salient.
3. Even when they believed that they had made their decision prior to this event, participants were significantly more likely than chance to report choosing the salient option when this option was made salient soon after the perceived time of choice.
4. Thus, without participants’ awareness, a seemingly later event influenced choices that were experienced as occurring at an earlier time.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Insofar as slip in an earthquake is related to the strain accumulated near a fault since a previous earthquake, and this process repeats many times, the earthquake cycle approximates an autonomous oscillator.
1. Its asymmetric slow accumulation of strain and rapid release is quite unlike the harmonic motion of a pendulum and need not be time predictable, but still resembles a class of repeating systems known as integrate-and-fire oscillators, whose behavior has been shown to demonstrate a remarkable ability to synchronize to either external or self-organized forcing.
2. Given sufficient time and even very weak physical coupling, the phases of sets of such oscillators, with similar though not necessarily identical period, approach each other.
3. Topological and time series analyses presented here demonstrate that earthquakes worldwide show evidence of such synchronization.
4. Though numerous studies demonstrate that the composite temporal distribution of major earthquakes in the instrumental record is indistinguishable from random, the additional consideration of event renewal interval serves to identify earthquake groupings suggestive of synchronization that are absent in synthetic catalogs.
5. We envisage the weak forces responsible for clustering originate from lithospheric strain induced by seismicity itself, by finite strains over teleseismic distances, or by other sources of lithospheric loading such as Earth's variable rotation.
6. For example, quasi-periodic maxima in rotational deceleration are accompanied by increased global seismicity at multidecadal intervals.

0. Transforming a laser beam into a mass flow has been a challenge both scientifically and technologically.
1. We report the discovery of a new optofluidic principle and demonstrate the generation of a steady-state water flow by a pulsed laser beam through a glass window.
2. To generate a flow or stream in the same path as the refracted laser beam in pure water from an arbitrary spot on the window, we first fill a glass cuvette with an aqueous solution of Au nanoparticles.
3. A flow will emerge from the focused laser spot on the window after the laser is turned on for a few to tens of minutes; the flow remains after the colloidal solution is completely replaced by pure water.
4. Microscopically, this transformation is made possible by an underlying plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated cavity, which is self-fabricated on the glass by nanoparticle-assisted laser etching and exhibits size and shape uniquely tailored to the incident beam profile.
5. Hydrophone signals indicate that the flow is driven via acoustic streaming by a long-lasting ultrasound wave that is resonantly generated by the laser and the cavity through the photoacoustic effect.
6. The principle of this light-driven flow via ultrasound, that is, photoacoustic streaming by coupling photoacoustics to acoustic streaming, is general and can be applied to any liquid, opening up new research and applications in optofluidics as well as traditional photoacoustics and acoustic streaming.

1. The lightning enhancement is most prominent during the convectively active season, November–April for the Indian Ocean and April–December in the South China Sea, and has been detectable from at least 2005 to the present.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The kinetics of energy storage in transition metal oxides are usually limited by solid-state diffusion, and the strategy most often utilized to improve their rate capability is to reduce ion diffusion distances by utilizing nanostructured materials.
1. Here, another strategy for improving the kinetics of layered transition metal oxides by the presence of structural water is proposed.
2. To investigate this strategy, the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide, WO3·2H2O, is compared with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte.
3. It is found that the presence of structural water leads to a transition from battery-like behavior in the anhydrous WO3 to ideally pseudocapacitive behavior in WO3·2H2O.
4. As a result, WO3·2H2O exhibits significantly improved capacity retention and energy efficiency for proton storage over WO3 at sweep rates as fast as 200 mV s–1, corresponding to charge/discharge times of just a few seconds.
5. Importantly, the energy storage of WO3·2H2O at such rates is nearly 100% efficient, unlike in the case of anhydrous WO3.
6. Pseudocapacitance in WO3·2H2O allows for high-mass loading electrodes (>3 mg cm–2) and high areal capacitances (>0.25 F cm–2 at 200 mV s–1) with simple slurry-cast electrodes.
7. These results demonstrate a new approach for developing pseudocapacitance in layered transition metal oxides for high-power energy storage, as well as the importance of energy efficiency as a metric of performance of pseudocapacitive materials.

1. The question of whether SO2 frost on the surface plays a part, and to what degree, in maintaining Io's atmosphere with the constant volcanic outgassing is still debated.
2. It is believed that for a sublimation-supported atmosphere, the primary atmosphere should collapse during eclipses by Jupiter, as the SO2 vapor pressure is strongly coupled to the temperature of the ice on the surface.

1. We recently reported evidence for transient Hoogsteen (HG) base pairs in canonical B-DNA based on NMR carbon relaxation dispersion.
2. While the carbon chemical shifts measured for the transient state were consistent with a syn orientation for the purine base, as expected for A(syn)•T(anti) and G(syn)•C+(anti) HG base pairing, HG type hydrogen bonding could only be inferred indirectly.
3. Here, we develop two independent approaches for directly probing transient changes in N–H···N hydrogen bonds and apply them to the characterization of transient Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonds in canonical duplex DNA.
4. The first approach takes advantage of the strong dependence of the imino nitrogen chemical shift on hydrogen bonding and involves measurement of R1ρ relaxation dispersion for the hydrogen-bond donor imino nitrogens in G and T residues.
5. In the second approach, we assess the consequence of substituting the hydrogen-bond acceptor nitrogen (N7) with a carbon (C7H7) on both carbon and nitrogen relaxation dispersion data.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Although listed as one of the most significant events of the last 80 years, the space weather storm of late May 1967 has been of mostly fading academic interest.
1. The storm made its initial mark with a colossal solar radio burst causing radio interference at frequencies between 0.01 and 9.0 GHz and near-simultaneous disruptions of dayside radio communication by intense fluxes of ionizing solar X-rays.
2. Aspects of military control and communication were immediately challenged.
3. Within hours a solar energetic particle event disrupted high-frequency communication in the polar cap.
4. Subsequently, record-setting geomagnetic and ionospheric storms compounded the disruptions.
5. We explain how the May 1967 storm was nearly one with ultimate societal impact, were it not for the nascent efforts of the United States Air Force in expanding its terrestrial weather monitoring-analysis-warning-prediction efforts into the realm of space weather forecasting.
6. An important and long-lasting outcome of this storm was more formal Department of Defense-support for current-day space weather forecasting.
7. This story develops during the rapid rise of solar cycle 20 and the intense Cold War in the latter half of the twentieth century.
8. We detail the events of late May 1967 in the intersecting categories of solar-terrestrial interactions and the political-military backdrop of the Cold War.
9. This was one of the “Great Storms” of the twentieth century, despite the apparent lack of large geomagnetically induced currents.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The transparent conducting electrode is an essential component in many contemporary and future devices, ranging from displays to solar cells.
1. Fabricating transparent electrodes requires a balancing act between sufficient electrical conductivity and high light transmittance, both affected by the involved materials, fabrication methodology, and design.
2. While metal films possess the highest conductivity at room temperature, a decent optical transmittance can only be achieved with ultrathin films.
3. Structuring the metal into optically invisible nanowires has been shown to be promising to complement or even substitute transparent conductive oxides as dominant transparent electrode material.
4. Here the out-of-plane fabrication capability of the recently developed method of electrohydrodynamic NanoDrip printing to pattern gold and silver nanogrids with line widths from 80 to 500 nm is demonstrated.
5. This fully additive process enables the printing of high aspect ratio nanowalls and by that significantly improves the electrical performance, while maintaining the optical transmittance at a high level.
6. Metal grid transparent electrodes optimized for low sheet resistances (8 Ω sq−1 at a relative transmittance of 94%) as well as optimized for high transmittance (97% at a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1) are reported, which can be tailored on demand for the use in various applications.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. The timing and mode of deposition for Martian regolith breccia Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 were determined by combining petrography, shape analysis, and thermochronology.
1. NWA 7034 is composed of igneous, impact, and brecciated clasts within a thermally annealed submicron matrix of pulverized crustal rocks and devitrified impact/volcanic glass.
2. The brecciated clasts are likely lithified portions of Martian regolith with some evidence of past hydrothermal activity.
3. Represented lithologies are primarily ancient crustal materials with crystallization ages as old as 4.4 Ga. One ancient zircon was hosted by an alkali-rich basalt clast, confirming that alkalic volcanism occurred on Mars very early.
4. NWA 7034 is composed of fragmented particles that do not exhibit evidence of having undergone bed load transport by wind or water.
5. The clast size distribution is similar to terrestrial pyroclastic deposits.
6. We infer that the clasts were deposited by atmospheric rainout subsequent to a pyroclastic eruption(s) and/or impact event(s), although the ancient ages of igneous components favor mobilization by impact(s).
7. Despite ancient components, the breccia has undergone a single pervasive thermal event at 500–800°C, evident by groundmass texture and concordance of ~1.5 Ga dates for bulk rock K-Ar, U-Pb in apatite, and U-Pb in metamict zircons.
8. The 1.5 Ga age is likely a thermal event that coincides with rainout/breccia lithification.
9. We infer that the episodic process of regolith lithification dominated sedimentary processes during the Amazonian Epoch.
10. The absence of pre-Amazonian high-temperature metamorphic events recorded in ancient zircons indicates source domains of static southern highland crust punctuated by episodic impact modification.

0. Smartphones such as Android phones and iPhones are widely adopted worldwide and the number of smartphone users has increased dramatically.
1. With the popularity of smartphones, the privacy of smartphone users are challenged by various malware and attacks.
2. A large amount of malware has been developed and spread such as Soundcomber, Screenmilker, TouchLogger, and so on.
3. In addition, some smartphone attacks are based on physical access to the phone like smudge attacks.
4. All these have reminded current users to pay more attention for smartphone security such as installing anti-malware software to defend against malicious apps, which may reduce the effectiveness of most malware.
5. In this paper, we identify a vulnerability of smartphone charging and design a new type of charging attacks (called juice filming attacks) based on a standard USB connector and HDMI, which can steal users' secrets through automatically video-capturing their inputs (e.g., unlock patterns, PIN code).
6. The efficiency of our designed attacks relies on the observations that users are not aware of any risk when charging their phones in public places and that most users would interact with their phone during the charging.
7. Different from other malware and attacks, our designed juice filming attacks possess six major features: 1) be simple but quite efficient; 2) user unawareness; 3) does not need to install any apps on phone's side; 4) does not need to ask for any permissions; 5) cannot be detected by any current anti-malware software; 6) can be scalable and effective in both Android OS and iOS.
8. To implement this attack, we employ a VGA/RGB frame grabber and further conduct several user studies to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of our attacks.
9. Based on the understanding, we later propose several mitigation strategies to defend against such attacks.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Gravity waves have a significant impact on both the dynamics and energy budget of the Martian thermosphere.
1. Strong density variations of spatial scales indicative of gravity waves have previously been identified in this region by using in situ observations.
2. Here we use observations from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) mass spectrometer on Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission to identify such waves in the observations of different atmospheric species.
3. The wave signatures seen in CO2 and Ar are almost identical, whereas the wave signature seen in N2, which is lighter and has a larger scale height, is generally smaller in amplitude and slightly out of phase with those seen in CO2 and Ar.
4. Examination of the observed wave properties in these three species suggests that relatively long vertical wavelength atmospheric gravity waves are the likely source of the waves seen by NGIMS in the upper thermosphere.
5. A two-fluid linear model of the wave perturbations in CO2 and N2 has been used to find the best fit intrinsic wave parameters that match the observed features in these two species.
6. We report the first observationally based estimate of the heating and cooling rates of the Martian thermosphere created by the waves observed in this region.
7. The observed wave density amplitudes are anticorrelated with the background atmospheric temperature.
8. The estimated heating rates show a weak positive correlation with the wave amplitude, whereas the cooling rates show a clearer negative correlation with the wave amplitude.
9. Our estimates support previous model-based findings that atmospheric gravity waves are a significant source of both heating and cooling.

1. Participants recalled a recent time when they experienced three different anger-provoking events when driving.
2. They then rated their behaviours and emotions during the event, and their attributions for why the event occurred.
3. Participants also completed a battery of personality questionnaires designed to predict their responses to the situations.
4. Attributing causality for the anger-arousing event to a stable factor in the offending driver was uniquely related to aggressive behaviour and anger in all three situations.
5. Hostile and blame attributions predicted aggressive behaviour and anger in different situations.
6. In addition to dispositional measures of aggressiveness and anger predicting aggressive behaviour and anger in each of the anger-provoking situations, other personality variables were also related to aspects of the road rage response (e.g.
7. conscientiousness, agreeableness, narcissism, and extraversion).
8. Attributions and personality traits accounted for unique variance in the outcomes, and there were only sporadic effects of attributions partially mediating the relationships between personality variables and responses to the anger-provoking situations.
9. Therefore, it is unlikely that the relationships between personality traits and responses to anger-provoking situations are completely mediated by attributional processing.

2. Although buried by 2 km of ice, the structure's rim induces a conspicuously circular surface expression, it possesses a central uplift, and it causes a negative gravity anomaly.
3. The existence of two closely spaced and similarly sized complex craters raises the possibility that they formed during related impact events.
4. However, the second structure's morphology is shallower, its overlying ice is conformal and older, and such an event can be explained by chance.

1. In Australia, dingoes are the mainland apex predator and play an important role in ecological functioning.
2. Currently, however, they are threatened by hybridization with modern domestic dogs in the wild.
3. As a consequence, we explore how increasing our understanding of the evolutionary history of dingoes can inform management and conservation decisions.
4. Previous research on whole mitochondrial genome and nuclear data from five geographical populations showed evidence of two distinct lineages of dingo.
5. Here, we present data from a broader survey of dingoes around Australia using both mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers and investigate the timing of demographic expansions.
6. Biogeographic data corroborate the presence of at least two geographically subdivided genetic populations, southeastern and northwestern.
7. Demographic modeling suggests that dingoes have undergone population expansion in the last 5,000 years.
8. It is not clear whether this stems from expansion into vacant niches after the extinction of thylacines on the mainland or indicates the arrival date of dingoes.
9. Male dispersal is much more common than female, evidenced by more diffuse Y haplogroup distributions.
10. There is also evidence of likely historical male biased introgression from domestic dogs into dingoes, predominately within southeastern Australia.

Specifically, using a microablation approach we investigate how different regions of the dorsal head of adult horned beetles relate to their larval and embryonic counterparts and test whether deeply conserved regional boundaries that establish the embryonic head might also facilitate or bias the positioning of cephalic horns along the dorsal adult head.
3. We find that paired posterior horns—the most widespread horn type within the genus—are positioned along a border homologous to the embryonic clypeolabral (CL)–ocular boundary, and that this placement constitutes the ancestral form of horn positioning.
4. In contrast, we observed that the phylogenetically much rarer anterior horns are positioned by larval head regions contained firmly within the CL segment and away from any major preexisting larval head landmarks or boundaries.
5. Lastly, we describe the unexpected finding that ablations at medial head regions can result in ectopic outgrowths bearing terminal structures resembling the more anterior clypeal ridge.
6. We discuss our results in the light of the developmental genetic mechanisms of head formation in holometabolous insects and the role of co-option in innovation and bias in developmental evolution.

0. This study was undertaken to determine if the application of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHSs) to the hands of a breath test operator will affect the results obtained on evidential breath alcohol instruments (EBTs).
1. This study obtained breath samples on three different EBTs immediately after application of either gel or foam ABHS to the operator's hands.
2. A small, but significant, number of initial analyses (13 of 130, 10%) resulted in positive breath alcohol concentrations, while 41 samples (31.5%) resulted in a status code.
3. These status codes were caused by ethanol vapors either in the room air or their inhalation by the subject, thereby causing a mouth alcohol effect.
4. Replicate subject samples did not yield any consecutive positive numeric results.
5. As ABHS application can cause a transitory mouth alcohol effect via inhalation of ABHS vapors, EBT operators should forego the use of ABHS in the 15 min preceding subject testing.

0. Converging evidence from neuroscience suggests that our attention to the outside world waxes and wanes over time.
1. We examined whether these periods of “mind wandering” are associated with reduced cortical analysis of the external environment.
2. Participants performed a sustained attention to response task in which they responded to frequent “nontargets” (digits 0–9) and withheld responses for infrequent “targets” (the letter X).
3. Mind wandering was defined both behaviorally, indicated by a failure to withhold a response to a target, and subjectively, via self-report at a thought probe.
4. The P300 event-related potential component for nontargets was reduced prior to both the behavioral and subjective reports of mind wandering, relative to periods of being “on-task.” Regression analysis of P300 amplitude revealed significant common variance between behavioral and subjective markers of mind wandering, suggesting that both markers reflect a common underlying mental state.
5. Finally, control analysis revealed that the effect of mind wandering on the P300 could not be ascribed to changes in motor activity nor was it associated with general arousal.
6. Our data suggest that when trying to engage attention in a sustained manner, the mind will naturally ebb and flow in the depth of cognitive analysis it applies to events in the external environment.

0. Underwater vocalizations were recorded during repeated encounters with 16 pods, or stable kin groups, of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia.
1. Pods were identified from unique natural markings on individuals.
2. Vocal exchanges within pods were dominated by repetitious, discrete calls.
3. Pods each produced 7–17 (mean 10.7) types of discrete calls.
4. Individuals appear to acquire their pod's call repertoire by learning, and repertoires can persist with little change for over 25 years.
5. Call repertoires differed significantly among pods in the resident population.
6. The 16 pods formed four distinct acoustic associations, or clans, each having a unique repertoire of discrete calls, or vocal tradition.
7. Pods within a clan shared several call types, but no sharing took place among clans.
8. Shared calls often contained structural variations specific to each pod or group of pods in the clan.
9. These variants and other differences in acoustic behaviour formed a system of related pod-specific dialects within the vocal tradition of each clan.
10. Pods from different clans often travelled together, but observed patterns of social associations were often independent of acoustic relationships.
11. It is proposed that each clan comprises related pods that have descended from a common ancestral group.
12. New pods formed from this ancestral group through growth and matrilineal division of the lineage.
13. The formation of new pods was accompanied by divergence of the call repertoire of the founding group.
14. Such divergence resulted from the accumulation of errors in call learning across generations, call innovation, and call extinction.
15. Pod-specific repertoires probably serve to enhance the efficiency of vocal communication within the group and act as behavioural indicators of pod affiliation.
16. The striking differences among the vocal traditions of different clans suggest that each is an independent matriline.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Marine plastic debris is a global environmental problem.
1. Surveys have shown that <5 mm plastic particles, known as microplastics, are significantly more abundant in surface seawater and on shorelines than larger plastic particles are.
2. Nevertheless, quantification of microplastics in the environment is hampered by a lack of adequate high-throughput methods for distinguishing and quantifying smaller size fractions (<1 mm), and this has probably resulted in an underestimation of actual microplastic concentrations.
3. Here we present a protocol that allows high-throughput detection and automated quantification of small microplastic particles (20–1000 μm) using the dye Nile red, fluorescence microscopy, and image analysis software.
4. This protocol has proven to be highly effective in the quantification of small polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and nylon-6 particles, which frequently occur in the water column.
5. Our preliminary results from sea surface tows show a power-law increase in small microplastics (i.e., <1 mm) with a decreasing particle size.
6. Hence, our data help to resolve speculation about the “apparent” loss of this fraction from surface waters.
7. We consider that this method presents a step change in the ability to detect small microplastics by substituting the subjectivity of human visual sorting with a sensitive and semiautomated procedure.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. Mass extinctions have profoundly influenced the history of life, not only through the death of species but also through changes in ecosystem function and structure.
1. Importantly, these events allow us the opportunity to study ecological dynamics under levels of environmental stress for which there are no recent analogues.
2. Here, we examine the impact and selectivity of the Late Triassic mass extinction event on the functional diversity and functional composition of the global marine ecosystem, and test whether post-extinction communities in the Early Jurassic represent a regime shift away from pre-extinction communities in the Late Triassic.
3. Our analyses show that, despite severe taxonomic losses, there is no unequivocal loss of global functional diversity associated with the extinction.
4. Even though no functional groups were lost, the extinction event was, however, highly selective against some modes of life, in particular sessile suspension feeders.
5. Although taxa with heavily calcified skeletons suffered higher extinction than other taxa, lightly calcified taxa also appear to have been selected against.
6. The extinction appears to have invigorated the already ongoing faunal turnover associated with the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.
7. The ecological effects of the Late Triassic mass extinction were preferentially felt in the tropical latitudes, especially amongst reefs, and it took until the Middle Jurassic for reef ecosystems to fully recover to pre-extinction levels.

0. Submarine lava flows are the most common surficial igneous rock on the Earth.
1. However, they are inherently more difficult to study than their subaerial counterparts due to their inaccessibility.
2. In this study, we use newly acquired 3-D (three-dimensional) seismic reflection data to document the distribution and morphology of 26 ancient, buried lava flows within the middle Eocene-aged Bight Basin Igneous Complex, offshore southern Australia.
3. Many of these lava flows are associated with volcanoes that vary from 60 to 625 m in height and 0.3 to 10 km in diameter.
4. Well data and seismic-stratigraphic relationships suggest that the lava flows and volcanoes were emplaced offshore in water depths of <300 m. The lava flows range from 0.5 to 34 km in length and 1 to 15 km in width and are typified by tabular and dendritic forms.
5. This morphological variation may result from differing lava effusion rates and/or the volumes of lava erupted.
6. We demonstrate that: (1) the dendritic flows contain complex lava distribution systems and kipukas, features never-before observed from seismic data; and (2) the distribution and morphology of the lava flows was strongly controlled by the emplacement of magmatic intrusion-induced forced folds.
7. This suggests that magmatic intrusions may play an important role in controlling the distribution of lava flows elsewhere.
8. Our study highlights the usefulness of seismic data in studying the manifestation of submarine volcanism, and provides quantitative data on the extent and distribution of an ancient submarine volcanic province along the southern Australian margin.

0. Fossil microbiotas are rare in the early rock record, limiting the type of ecological information extractable from ancient microbialites.
1. In the absence of body fossils, emphasis may instead be given to microbially derived features, such as microbialite growth patterns, microbial mat morphologies, and the presence of fossilized gas bubbles in lithified mats.
2. The metabolic affinity of micro-organisms associated with phosphatization may reveal important clues to the nature and accretion of apatite-rich microbialites.
3. Stromatolites from the 1.6 Ga Chitrakoot Formation (Semri Group, Vindhyan Supergroup) in central India contain abundant fossilized bubbles interspersed within fine-grained in situ-precipitated apatite mats with average δ13Corg indicative of carbon fixation by the Calvin cycle.
4. In addition, the mats hold a synsedimentary fossil biota characteristic of cyanobacterial and rhodophyte morphotypes.
5. Phosphatic oncoid cone-like stromatolites from the Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup (Jhamarkotra Formation) comprise abundant mineralized bubbles enmeshed within tufted filamentous mat fabrics.
6. Construction of these tufts is considered to be the result of filamentous bacteria gliding within microbial mats, and as fossilized bubbles within pristine mat laminae can be used as a proxy for oxygenic phototrophy, this provides a strong indication for cyanobacterial activity in the Aravalli mounds.
7. We suggest that the activity of oxygenic phototrophs may have been significant for the formation of apatite in both Vindhyan and Aravalli stromatolites, mainly by concentrating phosphate and creating steep diurnal redox gradients within mat pore spaces, promoting apatite precipitation.
8. The presence in the Indian stromatolites of alternating apatite-carbonate lamina may result from local variations in pH and oxygen levels caused by photosynthesis–respiration in the mats.
9. Altogether, this study presents new insights into the ecology of ancient phosphatic stromatolites and warrants further exploration into the role of oxygen-producing biotas in the formation of Paleoproterozoic shallow-basin phosphorites.

0. The neurohormone oxytocin (OT) has been one the most studied peptides in behavioural sciences over the past two decades.
1. Primarily known for its crucial role in labour and lactation, a rapidly growing literature suggests that intranasal OT (IN-OT) may also play a role in the emotional and social lives of humans.
2. However, the lack of a convincing theoretical framework explaining the effects of IN-OT that would also allow the prediction of which moderators exert their effects and when has raised healthy skepticism regarding the robustness of human behavioural IN-OT research.
3. Poor knowledge of the exact pharmacokinetic properties of OT, as well as crucial statistical and methodological issues and the absence of direct replication efforts, may have lead to a publication bias in the IN-OT literature, with many unpublished studies with null results remaining buried in laboratory drawers.

0. Given a dynamic graph subject to insertions and deletions of edges, a natural question is whether the graph presently admits a planar embedding.
1. We give a deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm for general graphs, running in amortized O(log3 n) time per edge insertion or deletion, that maintains a bit indicating whether or not the graph is presently planar.
2. This is an exponential improvement over the previous best algorithm [Eppstein, Galil, Italiano, Spencer, 1996] which spends amortized O(√n) time per update.

0. Twin and family studies suggest that political attitudes are partially determined by an individual's genotype.
1. The dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III repeat region that has been extensively studied in connection with human behaviour, is a plausible candidate to contribute to individual differences in political attitudes.
2. A first United States study provisionally identified this gene with political attitude along a liberal–conservative axis albeit contingent upon number of friends.
3. In a large sample of 1771 Han Chinese university students in Singapore, we observed a significant main effect of association between the DRD4 exon III variable number of tandem repeats and political attitude.
4. Subjects with two copies of the 4-repeat allele (4R/4R) were significantly more conservative.
5. Our results provided evidence for a role of the DRD4 gene variants in contributing to individual differences in political attitude particularly in females and more generally suggested that associations between individual genes, and neurochemical pathways, contributing to traits relevant to the social sciences can be provisionally identified.

0. The interdisciplinary nature of conservation science has generated much discussion.
1. Previous scholars have highlighted the lack of mutual understanding between the natural and social sciences in terms of theoretical knowledge and methodological practices.
2. Due to this, the potential for the ‘tragedy of (un)common knowledge’ may hinder interdisciplinary scholarship within conservation science.
3. While others have provided valuable insight on the scholarly and pedagogic challenges associated with interdisciplinary research, there has been little dialogue on the methodological components.
4. Based on an ethnographic study on law enforcement rangers in a protected area in Uganda, this article provides key reflections on entrée, forming trust and rapport, establishing an identity, and data collection.

Question: Which of the numbered sentences support the claim? Answer with only a list of numbers.
0. As a major contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it has been suggested that reducing animal agriculture or consumption of animal-derived foods may reduce GHGs and enhance food security.
1. Because the total removal of animals provides the extreme boundary to potential mitigation options and requires the fewest assumptions to model, the yearly nutritional and GHG impacts of eliminating animals from US agriculture were quantified.
2. Animal-derived foods currently provide energy (24% of total), protein (48%), essential fatty acids (23–100%), and essential amino acids (34–67%) available for human consumption in the United States.
3. The US livestock industry employs 1.6 × 106 people and accounts for $31.8 billion in exports.
4. Livestock recycle more than 43.2 × 109 kg of human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts, converting them into human-edible food, pet food, industrial products, and 4 × 109 kg of N fertilizer.
5. Although modeled plants-only agriculture produced 23% more food, it met fewer of the US population’s requirements for essential nutrients.
6. When nutritional adequacy was evaluated by using least-cost diets produced from foods available, more nutrient deficiencies, a greater excess of energy, and a need to consume a greater amount of food solids were encountered in plants-only diets.
7. In the simulated system with no animals, estimated agricultural GHG decreased (28%), but did not fully counterbalance the animal contribution of GHG (49% in this model).
8. This assessment suggests that removing animals from US agriculture would reduce agricultural GHG emissions, but would also create a food supply incapable of supporting the US population’s nutritional requirements.

0. Associations between specific red meat subtypes and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies.
1. However, no publication to date has summarised the overall epidemiological evidence.
2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies (cohort, nested case-control or case-cohort studies), which reported relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between intake of meat subtypes with colorectal, colon or rectal cancer or colorectal adenoma risk.
3. PubMed and ISI Web of Science were searched up until August 1, 2014.
4. Nineteen studies examined meat subtypes (5 beef, 5 pork, 2 lamb, 1 veal and 19 poultry) and associations with colorectal, colon or rectal cancer risk and 4 studies examined associations with adenoma risk (1 beef and 4 poultry).
5. Comparing highest versus lowest intake, beef consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.22) and colon cancer (RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.44), but no association was found with rectal cancer (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.16).
6. Higher consumption of lamb was also associated with increased risk of CRC (RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.44).
7. No association was observed for pork (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.27), but some between study heterogeneity was observed.
8. No association was observed for poultry consumption and risk of colorectal adenomas or cancer.
9. This meta-analysis suggests that red meat subtypes differ in their association with CRC and its sub sites.

0. As the Earth warms, carbon sinks on land and in the ocean will weaken, thereby increasing the rate of warming.
1. Although natural mechanisms contributing to this positive climate–carbon feedback have been evaluated using Earth system models, analogous feedbacks involving human activities have not been systematically quantified.
2. Here we conceptualize and estimate the magnitude of several economic mechanisms that generate a carbon–climate feedback, using the Kaya identity to separate a net economic feedback into components associated with population, GDP, heating and cooling, and the carbon intensity of energy production and transportation.
3. We find that climate-driven decreases in economic activity (GDP) may in turn decrease human energy use and thus fossil fuel CO2 emissions.
4. In a high radiative forcing scenario, such decreases in economic activity reduce fossil fuel emissions by 13% this century, lowering atmospheric CO2 by over 100 ppm in 2100.
5. The natural carbon–climate feedback, in contrast, increases atmospheric CO2 over this period by a similar amount, and thus, the net effect including both feedbacks is nearly zero.
6. Our work highlights the importance of improving the representation of climate–economic feedbacks in scenarios of future change.
7. Although the effects of climate warming on the economy may offset weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, a loss of economic productivity will have high societal costs, potentially increasing wealth inequity and limiting resources available for effective adaptation.

0. Observations of surface ozone available from ∼1,000 sites across China for the past 5 years (2013–2017) show severe summertime pollution and regionally variable trends.
1. We resolve the effect of meteorological variability on the ozone trends by using a multiple linear regression model.
2. The residual of this regression shows increasing ozone trends of 1–3 ppbv a−1 in megacity clusters of eastern China that we attribute to changes in anthropogenic emissions.
3. By contrast, ozone decreased in some areas of southern China.
4. Anthropogenic NOx emissions in China are estimated to have decreased by 21% during 2013–2017, whereas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions changed little.
5. Decreasing NOx would increase ozone under the VOC-limited conditions thought to prevail in urban China while decreasing ozone under rural NOx-limited conditions.
6. However, simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemical Transport Model (GEOS-Chem) indicate that a more important factor for ozone trends in the North China Plain is the ∼40% decrease of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the 2013–2017 period, slowing down the aerosol sink of hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals and thus stimulating ozone production.

1. We use sedimentary charcoal accumulation rates to construct long-term variations in fire during the past 3,000 y in the American West and compare this record to independent fire-history data from historical records and fire scars.
2. There has been a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca.
3. 1400–1700 CE [Common Era]).
4. Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca.
5. 950–1250 CE) and during the 1800s.
6. Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE.
7. Since the late 1800s, human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline.
8. Consequently, there is now a forest “fire deficit” in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecological, and climate changes.
9. Large fires in the late 20th and 21st century fires have begun to address the fire deficit, but it is continuing to grow.

0. Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change.
1. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States.
2. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000–2015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (>1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential.
3. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades.
4. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984–2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence.
5. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.

3. Histologic analysis revealed that neovascularization at the membrane–tissue interface occurred in several membranes that had pore sizes large enough to allow complete penetration by host cells (0.8-8-μm pore size).
4. When the vascularization of the membrane–tissue interface of 5-μm-pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was compared to 0.02-μm-pore-size PTFE membranes, it was found that the larger pore membranes had 80–100-fold more vascular structures.
5. The increased vascularization was observed even though the larger pore membrane was laminated to a smaller pore inner membrane to prevent cell entry into the prototype immunoisolation device.
6. This significantly higher level of vascularization was maintained for 1 year in the subcutaneous site in rats.

0. Many neuropsychiatric illnesses are associated with psychosis, i.e., hallucinations (perceptions in the absence of causative stimuli) and delusions (irrational, often bizarre beliefs).
1. Current models of brain function view perception as a combination of two distinct sources of information: bottom-up sensory input and top-down influences from prior knowledge.
2. This framework may explain hallucinations and delusions.
3. Here, we characterized the balance between visual bottom-up and top-down processing in people with early psychosis (study 1) and in psychosis-prone, healthy individuals (study 2) to elucidate the mechanisms that might contribute to the emergence of psychotic experiences.
4. Through a specialized mental-health service, we identified unmedicated individuals who experience early psychotic symptoms but fall below the threshold for a categorical diagnosis.
5. We observed that, in early psychosis, there was a shift in information processing favoring prior knowledge over incoming sensory evidence.
6. In the complementary study, we capitalized on subtle variations in perception and belief in the general population that exhibit graded similarity with psychotic experiences (schizotypy).
7. We observed that the degree of psychosis proneness in healthy individuals, and, specifically, the presence of subtle perceptual alterations, is also associated with stronger reliance on prior knowledge.
8. Although, in the current experimental studies, this shift conferred a performance benefit, under most natural viewing situations, it may provoke anomalous perceptual experiences.
9. Overall, we show that early psychosis and psychosis proneness both entail a basic shift in visual information processing, favoring prior knowledge over incoming sensory evidence.
10. The studies provide complementary insights to a mechanism by which psychotic symptoms may emerge.

0. Hemostasis is a key biological feature that prevents sustained bleeding upon injury.1 Acute thrombosis, a leading cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide, is a pathological hemostatic condition, which is mainly caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque leading to myocardial infarction or stroke.1, 2 These unwanted intravascular blood thrombi cause vascular occlusions and organ damage due to prolonged lack of oxygen.
1. [1] As a first line of defense, fast-acting thrombolytic drugs, such as plasminogen activators (PAs), are administered to stop thrombus growth and to quickly induce thrombus deconstruction.3 However, systemic (intravenous) or local (catheter) delivery of PAs is deemed neither effective nor safe due to either rapid neutralization by their antidotes (e.g., plasminogen activator inhibitor) or bleeding complications that may lead to intracranial hemorrhages.1 With no safe thrombolytic treatments currently available and a lack of timely treatments, acute thrombosis remains a major healthcare issue contributing to a significant number of deaths and disabilities.

0. Photo-identification is based on the premise that photographs are representative of facial appearance.
1. However, previous studies show that ratings of likeness vary across different photographs of the same face, suggesting that some images capture identity better than others.
2. Two experiments were designed to examine the relationship between likeness judgments and face matching accuracy.
3. In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching accuracy for self-selected and other-selected high-likeness images.
4. Surprisingly, images selected by previously unfamiliar viewers – after very limited exposure to a target face – were more accurately matched than self-selected images chosen by the target identity themselves.
5. Results also revealed extremely low inter-rater agreement in ratings of likeness across participants, suggesting that perceptions of image resemblance are inherently unstable.
6. In Experiment 2, we test whether the cost of self-selection can be explained by this general disagreement in likeness judgments between individual raters.
7. We find that averaging across rankings by multiple raters produces image selections that provide superior identification accuracy.
8. However, benefit of other-selection persisted for single raters, suggesting that inaccurate representations of self interfere with our ability to judge which images faithfully represent our current appearance.

3. The delivered CRISPR-Cas system destroys both antibiotic resistance-conferring plasmids and genetically modified lytic phages.
4. This linkage between antibiotic sensitization and protection from lytic phages is a key feature of the strategy.
5. It allows programming of lytic phages to kill only antibiotic-resistant bacteria while protecting antibiotic-sensitized bacteria.

0. In the past 50 y, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality, with adverse consequences on general health.
1. A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime.
2. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep.
3. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength–enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock.
4. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep.
5. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime.
6. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book.
7. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.

0. Caloric restriction (CR), a reduction in calorie intake without malnutrition, retards aging in several animal models from worms to mammals.
1. Developing CR mimetics, compounds that reproduce the longevity benefits of CR without its side effects, is of widespread interest.
2. Here, we employed the Connectivity Map to identify drugs with overlapping gene expression profiles with CR.
3. Eleven statistically significant compounds were predicted as CR mimetics using this bioinformatics approach.
4. We then tested rapamycin, allantoin, trichostatin A, LY-294002 and geldanamycin in Caenorhabditis elegans.
5. An increase in lifespan and healthspan was observed for all drugs except geldanamycin when fed to wild-type worms, but no lifespan effects were observed in eat-2 mutant worms, a genetic model of CR, suggesting that life-extending effects may be acting via CR-related mechanisms.
6. We also treated daf-16 worms with rapamycin, allantoin or trichostatin A, and a lifespan extension was observed, suggesting that these drugs act via DAF-16-independent mechanisms, as would be expected from CR mimetics.
7. Supporting this idea, an analysis of predictive targets of the drugs extending lifespan indicates various genes within CR and longevity networks.
8. We also assessed the transcriptional profile of worms treated with either rapamycin or allantoin and found that both drugs use several specific pathways that do not overlap, indicating different modes of action for each compound.
9. The current work validates the capabilities of this bioinformatic drug repositioning method in the context of longevity and reveals new putative CR mimetics that warrant further studies.
